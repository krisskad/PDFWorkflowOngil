Complete road section names in the format \"[Location]-[Location] section\"\n  2. Starting location name for each road section\n  3. Ending location name for each road section\n  4. Any variations in naming convention (e.g., \"Road section [Location]-[Location]\")\n  5. Any additional descriptors or qualifiers attached to road sections\n  6. Context in which road sections are mentioned (e.g., construction, maintenance, planning)\n  \n  INSTRUCTIONS:\n  - The input will be document text that may contain road section references\n  - Search for the pattern of two location names connected by a hyphen and followed by the word \"section\"\n  - Look for variations such as \"section of [Location]-[Location]\" or \"[Location]-[Location] road section\"\n  - Pay attention to capitalization patterns in section names\n  - Extract the complete road section name along with its immediate context\n  - Note any additional information about the road sections (length, status, etc.)\n  - Compile a comprehensive list of all unique road section names found in the document\n  - Flag any ambiguous cases where it's unclear if text represents a road section name\n\n{document_text}"}
