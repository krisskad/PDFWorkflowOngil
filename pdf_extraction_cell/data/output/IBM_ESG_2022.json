        "content": "5 \nIBM 2022 ESG Report \nArvind Krishna \nChairman and Chief Executive Officer \nLetter from Our Chairman and CEO \nIBMers have always aspired to make a lasting, positive impact on the world \u2014 both internally, and in our work with clients \nand partners. We have a strong heritage of aligning business goals with broader ethical, equitable and environmental \nimpact. This is another critical way we fulfill our mission to be the catalyst that makes the world work better. \nAs a company that works in almost every industry \nand every sector, the trust that our clients place \nin us is incredibly important. When it comes to \ndeploying transformative technologies like artificial \nintelligence, trust is paramount. The advent of \nfoundation models and large language models has \ngenerated tremendous interest in AI, making the \ntechnology faster, more accessible and powerful \nto use than ever before. At the same time, we must \ntake every necessary measure to ensure that AI \nis used ethically and equitably to benefit society. \nThis IBM Impact report documents how we are \naccomplishing this while leading with ethics, \ntransparency and trust; promoting diversity, equity, \nand inclusion; and helping the environment. \nEthical Impact \nIBM has for decades followed core principles \n\u2013 grounded in commitments to Trust and \nTransparency \u2013 that guide our handling of client \ndata and insights and the responsible development \nand deployment of new technologies. We have also \ncreated a number of tools to help ensure that AI \nsystems are fair, robust, explainable, accountable, \nand aligned with the values of the society for \nwhich they\u2019re designed. Examples include IBM \nDesign for Sustainability, IBM OpenPages\u2122 with \nWatson, IBM Watson\u2122 Knowledge Catalog, and \nIBM AI FactSheets. In 2022, we trained over 1,000 \necosystem partners in technology ethics, surpassing \nour initial commitment, and we have launched \na new commitment to train 1,000 technology \nsuppliers in tech ethics over two years. Together \nwith academic partners, the Notre Dame IBM Tech \nEthics Lab launched 27 projects related to the ethics \nof technology and convened a Global University \nSummit to discuss how the principles of the Rome \nCall for AI Ethics might be put into practice. \nEquitable Impact \nIn 2022, we saw a year-over-year increase in \noverall representation for women globally, and \nBlack, Hispanic, Native American, and Pan-Asian \ncommunities in the U.S. To help ensure an inclusive \nworkplace, IBM\u2019s Global Real Estate and Diversity \n& Inclusion teams collaborated with employees \naround the world on design features to make our \nfacilities more accessible, welcoming, and productive \nfor IBMers and our clients. As part of our efforts \nto develop multiple pathways to employment, we \nhave committed to investing $250 million in skills-\nfirst training like our apprenticeship program. We \nhave hired over 900 apprentices through our U.S. \napprenticeship program, with more than 90% of \npast program graduates becoming full-time IBM \nemployees. Two years ago, we launched a global \nplan to provide 30 million people with new skills \nneeded for the jobs of tomorrow by 2030. We have \nmade significant progress toward this goal, with \nover 7 million learners enrolled in IBM courses. We \nalso continue to advance our goal of having 15% of \nIBM\u2019s first-tier diversity spending with Black-owned \nsuppliers by 2025. \nEnvironmental Impact \nIBM was proud to be named technology partner of \nthe 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, \nor COP27, where we showcased how our technology \nand expertise are helping business and government \nalign sustainability goals to organizational objectives. \nThat includes using Envizi and our Environmental \nIntelligence Suite to help clients understand and \nmitigate risks from climate change. With the latest \nIBM z16\u2122 and IBM\u00ae LinuxONE Rockhopper 4 \nsystems, we are delivering security and performance \nwhile helping clients of all sizes save on data center \nspace and energy consumption. IBM was proud to \nbe recognized by Boston Consulting Group and TIME \nMagazine for helping clients turn their sustainability \nambitions into actions. We are also making progress \ntowards our goal of net-zero operational greenhouse \ngas emissions by 2030. In 2021, we reported a \n61.6% reduction of emissions since 2010. Over the \nlast two years we completed a total of 1,455 energy \nconservation projects. As a result of conservation \nprojects implemented in 2022, we avoided 71,000 \nMWh of energy consumption and 25,600 metric tons \nof CO2 emissions. We also diverted 93.8% (by weight) \nof IBM\u2019s total nonhazardous waste from landfill \nor incineration. Last year we held our first annual \nSupplier Sustainability Leadership Symposium to \npromote energy efficiency. \nI invite you to read more about our efforts in this \ncomprehensive report. While we are proud of the \nprogress we have made, we are mindful that advancing \nour environmental, social and governance goals is \na continuous journey of improvement. I am always \ninspired by IBMers\u2019 constant dedication to this \nessential work and their pursuit of a better future for all. \nArvind Krishna \nChairman and Chief Executive Officer \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nContents \nIntroduction \nGovernance \nSocial \nEnvironment \nAppendix \n\u2013",

        "content": "14 \nIBM 2022 ESG Report \nRisk Management \nWe maintain a consistent, systemic, and integrated \napproach to enterprise risk management (ERM). \nDesigned to identify, mitigate, and manage \nsignificant risks, our ERM function assesses risks \nacross the organization to develop a holistic, \nenterprise-level view of risks arising from evolving \nregulatory or financial environments, operations, \nor strategic planning and execution. This includes \nevaluation of ESG-related risks. \nOversight of risk management begins with our \nBoard of Directors, which is responsible for \nassessing our ERM approach and overseeing \nmanagement\u2019s execution of its risk responsibilities. \nIBM\u2019s risk professionals, including the Chief \nRisk Officer (CRO), work closely with senior \nmanagement to integrate risk assessment into \nBoard and committee briefings on topics of \nstrategic importance. \nThe Board and its three committees receive \nperiodic updates on the ERM program, and each \ncommittee examines specific risk components: \nAudit Committee \nReviews financial and audit risks identified through \nour ERM framework, including those related to \ncybersecurity, and oversees implementation of \nand compliance with IBM\u2019s Business Conduct \nGuidelines. \nExecutive Compensation and Management \nResources Committee \nReviews risks related to compensation programs \nand employee engagement as an indicator of \ncompany culture, and reviews IBM\u2019s human capital \nmanagement, diversity and inclusion, and other \nmanagement resources programs. \nDirectors and Corporate \nGovernance Committee \nReviews risks associated with governance, as well \nas corporate social responsibility, sustainability, \nenvironmental, and other societal and \ngovernance matters. \nAdditionally, our Chief Trust and Compliance \nOfficer reports regularly to the Board and to the \nAudit Committee on compliance-related matters \nand holds a private session with Audit Committee \nmembers at every meeting. \nOur senior management is responsible for assessing \nand managing the various risk exposures on a day-\nto-day basis. The ERM program is led by our CRO \n(reporting up through our Chief Financial Officer) \nwho drives senior leader decision making. This \nis achieved through a senior executive Country \nInvestment Board and operationalizes via a risk \ncouncil of business unit and process leaders, and \nsenior management\u2019s relevant governance forums. \nWe have developed tools that employ analytics and \nAI technologies to assist our ERM processes, and \nour Country Risk Scorecard identifies emerging risk \nareas. By leveraging a series of key risk indicators, \nwe can timely alert country and regional leadership \nof risk areas and proactively respond. \nWe promote a company culture of risk awareness \nthrough online education and mandatory training in \nareas such as business integrity and cybersecurity\u2014 \nincluding a new Risk Academy, where all employees \ncan take courses and earn badges on risk \nmanagement awareness and skills. Additionally, \nall employees are encouraged to report potential \nrisks through numerous channels (anonymously if \npreferred), or to local management. \nEnvironmental and Climate-Related Risks \nClimate change is a serious concern that warrants \nmeaningful action on a global basis. In addition \nto other risks identified by our ERM process, we \nconsider risks identified by the TCFD in our risk \nmanagement profile. IBM, like other companies, is \nsubject to potential climate-related risks and costs, \nsuch as those resulting from increased severe \nweather events, prolonged changes in temperature, \nnew regulations affecting hardware products \nand data centers, carbon taxes, and increased \nenvironmental disclosures requested or required by \nclients, regulators, and others. \nOur senior management assesses the significance \nof environmental and climate-related risks and \nopportunities and manages them accordingly. \nReports on IBM\u2019s environmental programs, \nchallenges, and emerging issues are regularly \nprovided to the Board and its Directors and \nCorporate Governance Committee. \nWe do not expect compliance with environmental \nlaws and climate change regulations to have a \ndisproportionate effect on the company or its \nfinancial position, results of operations, and \ncompetitive position. Conversely, we believe there \nis opportunity to use IBM\u2019s AI, hybrid cloud, and \nother technologies to assist clients with managing \ntheir climate-related risks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nContents \nIntroduction \nGovernance \nSocial \nEnvironment \nAppendix",

IBM \nbelieves that providing opportunities for self-\ndisclosure allows employees to voluntarily share their \nuniqueness. By self-identifying, we show awareness \nand may leverage differences by creating solutions \nand network opportunities for a successful company. \nOf employees who self-identified in 2022: \n\u2014 Over 9% self-identified as LGBTQ+ \n\u2014 Almost 5% self-identified as Veterans \n\u2014 Over 1% self-identified as People with \nDiverse Abilities \nResults inclusive of Red Hat.

On a comparative basis \nwith 2021, both purchasing spend and number \nof suppliers are considerably reduced as a result \nof the separation of our managed infrastructure \nbusiness in November 2021. \nSince 2010, IBM has required its first-tier \nsuppliers to create and maintain a social and \nenvironmental management system to address \ntheir responsibilities within a year of starting to do \nbusiness with us. IBM suppliers must establish \ntheir management systems, measure performance, \nset goals, disclose results, and cascade these \nrequirements to their upstream suppliers who \nperform work material to the goods and services \nprovided to IBM. See the IBM Supply Chain \nResponsibility website for more details. \nInformation on our promotion of environmental \nresponsibility among our global supply chain \ncan be found in the Supply Chain Environmental \nResponsibility section on page 49. \nResponsible Business Alliance (RBA): IBM is \na founding member of the RBA, a nonprofit \nindustry group that enables its members to \nstrive for continuous improvement in the social, \nenvironmental, and ethical responsibility of their \ncompanies, and upstream supply chains. \nWe require our first-tier suppliers of hardware, \nsoftware, and services (as well as IBM\u2019s internal \noperations) to adhere to the RBA Code of \nConduct, which contains provisions on labor, \nhealth and safety, environmental requirements, \nethics, and management systems. The RBA \ncode is the foundation for the social and \nenvironmental management system criteria that \nwe require our suppliers to maintain. \nTo help suppliers meet our requirements, we \nprovide and facilitate education, including online \naccess to the RBA learning academy that we \naugment with IBM developed materials. We \nregularly update these programs to address \nareas where assessments have revealed needed \nimprovement. \nWe encourage our suppliers to publish ESG reports \nto help drive greater supply chain transparency and \nbest practice sharing.

Through our membership \nin the RBA, we have been active in addressing this \nissue. In 2020, RBA membership adopted a code \nchange that explicitly addressed parameters to \nprevent forced labor in the supply chain. We have \nbuilt upon the RBA code provisions to develop \nonline training for our buyers and employees and \nhave collaborated with external parties to create a \ntechnology platform to assist multi-stakeholders in \ninterrupting modern slavery. Annually, we publish \ntwo reports in response to Australian and United \nKingdom legislation with details on our activities \nto combat modern slavery and forced labor. These \nreports are updated each June and are available on \nour IBM Impact website. \nResponsible Minerals Sourcing \nSince the passage of Section 1502 of the Dodd-\nFrank Financial Reform Act of 2010, our focus has \nbeen to ensure that 3TG minerals (tantalum, tin, \ntungsten, and gold) used in our products do not \ncontribute directly or indirectly to armed groups in \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining \ncountries. We deploy a multifaceted approach that \nincludes robust policies and practices, as well as \nexternal collaboration, to reach these objectives. \nOur responsible minerals sourcing policy is \naligned with the framework of the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) \nDue Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply \nChains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and \nHigh-Risk Areas (CAHRAs), including Annex II and \nthe related supplements pertaining to downstream \ncompanies. IBM has expanded its efforts to include \nethically sourced cobalt, following the approach we \nbuilt with our suppliers on 3TG. \nWe are an active member of the Responsible \nMinerals Initiative and engage directly with our in-\nscope suppliers to collaborate and build capacity, \nto assure lasting progress. We require in-scope \nsuppliers to source 3TG minerals from ethical \nsmelters or refiners (SORs) that are conformant \nor active in a recognized third-party validation \nscheme, or from 100% recycled scrap sources. \nIBM pairs skilled members of our responsible \nminerals team with first-tier (and upstream) \nsuppliers to work on training, best practice sharing, \nand overcoming the challenges of a dynamic \nmarket environment where SOR status changes \noccur and must be adapted to. Our working \nrelationships span multiple layers of the supply \nchain, in which many interrelationships exist, in \norder to sustain progress. \nAs a complementary activity, IBM\u2019s Responsible \nMinerals team maintains communications with \nour research community to keep them abreast \nof the challenges in the marketplace associated \nwith minerals sourcing. This can help to influence \nfuture development of products. As an example, \nthe IBM Almaden Research Center has invented a \nbattery technology free of nickel and cobalt, which \ncould potentially help eliminate the need for critical \nmetals in battery production and transform the \nlong-term sustainability of many elements of our \nenergy infrastructure. \nOur annual Conflict Minerals Report (CMR), \navailable in May, will include information on our \nin-scope suppliers\u2019 use of conformant 3TG SORs in \n2022. A library of current and past CMRs in addition \nto our Responsible Minerals policy, due diligence \nprocess, and our white paper \u201cIBM\u2019s Journey in \nResponsible Minerals Sourcing,\u201d are available on \nIBM\u2019s Responsible Minerals website. \nOur working relationships span \nmultiple layers of the supply chain, \nin which many interrelationships \nexist, in order to sustain progress. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nContents \nIntroduction \nGovernance \nSocial \nEnvironment \nAppendix",

We have \nmaintained an EMS for decades and continually \nupdate it to reflect our company\u2019s intersections with \nenvironmental matters. Setting and executing against \nvoluntary goals to drive continual improvement is an \nintegral part of our EMS. The global scope of our EMS \ncovers hardware product design and development, \nmanufacturing, data centers, real estate operations, \nprocurement, logistics, asset recovery services, and \nbusiness services. \nSince 1997, we have continuously maintained \nour single global registration to the ISO 14001 \nEMS standard. We also have maintained a single \nglobal registration of our EMS to the ISO 50001 \nenergy management systems standard since 2012. \nIn addition, our GHG emissions quantification \nprocess is certified against the ISO 14064-1:2018 \nstandard and our GHG emissions inventory and \ndisclosures are verified with limited assurance by \nan independent third-party using the ISO 14064\u00ad\n3:2019 standard. \nStakeholder Engagement \nWe proactively engage and collaborate \nwith stakeholders from a cross-section of \nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs), \ngovernment agencies, businesses, industry \nassociations, investors, academia, communities, \nand employees on environmental matters. Some \nexamples include: \nThe Climate Registry (TCR) \u2013 As a longtime \nproponent of transparency in environmental \nreporting, we supported the development of the \nrecently launched Net-Zero Portal by TCR.

Most \nof our data centers now incorporate hot/cold aisle \ncontainment.2 In addition, we continued to execute \nprojects aimed at enhancing the energy efficiency \nof both cooling and IT equipment, retrofitting \nlighting systems, and optimizing the operational \nefficiency of our building infrastructure. \n1In measuring performance against IBM\u2019s energy conservation goal, we only include the first year\u2019s savings from projects. Accordingly, IBM\u2019s total energy savings and CO2 emissions avoidance from these projects are greater than this simple \nsummation of the annual results. We do not include reductions in energy consumption resulting from downsizings, the sale of operations or cost-avoidance actions, such as fuel switching and off-peak load shifting, in our energy conservation results. \n2Hot/cold aisle containment is a strategy used in data centers to improve energy efficiency and reduce cooling costs. It involves organizing server racks in a way that achieves the greatest separation of hot exhaust air and cold intake air. \nIn 2021, we set a goal of 3,000 energy \nconservation projects by 2025.

In 2022, \nwithdrawals at these locations decreased by 0.19% \nversus 2021. \nThis decrease in water withdrawals was primarily \ndue to temporary or permanent building closures \nand reduced lawn irrigation, including some lawn \nirrigation reductions mandated by government. \nFor example, three major projects involved lawn \nconversions that replaced over 100,000 square \nfeet of grassy area with drought resistant native \nplants reducing the total annual landscape \nirrigation by approximately 9,200 cubic meters. \nIn addition, we reused or recycled over 24,000 \ncubic meters of water for landscape irrigation. \nOther water conservation efforts consisted \nof the installation of faucet aerators, reduce \nflush cisterns, and automatic faucet sensors in \nwashrooms. Results from our efforts to reduce \nwater withdrawals during 2022 were largely offset \nas more employees returned to offices. \nOur primary use of water at locations subject to \nthis goal is domestic water consumption in the \nworkplace (46% of total water withdrawals), cooling \nand humidity control at office buildings (25% of \ntotal water withdrawals), and irrigation of lawns \nand gardens (19% of total water withdrawals). We \ninstalled more than 100 water meters in campuses \nin India and South America which resulted in more \naccurate measurement of our water consumption \nin multi-tenant buildings where we previously relied \nupon estimates. \nIBM also continues to look for opportunities to \nreduce water consumption at locations outside of \nwater-stressed regions. In 2022, more than 11,400 \ncubic meters of water were saved through various \nconservation projects, including optimization \nof reverse osmosis deionized water systems to \ngenerate less wastewater, utilization of rainwater, \nand routine maintenance of water pipes. \nPaper and Paper/Wood-Based Packaging \nSourced from Sustainably Managed Forests \nFor paper and paper/wood-based packaging that \nis directly procured by IBM, our goal is to source it \nfrom sustainably managed forests. Suppliers must \nprovide evidence that their sources have been \ncertified by an accredited third-party certification \nprogram such as the Forest Stewardship Council, \nProgramme for the Endorsement of Forest \nCertification, Sustainable Forestry Initiative, or the \nCanadian Standards Association Group Sustainable \nForest Management System standard. \nIn 2022, 99.5% (based on spend) of the paper \nand paper/wood-based packaging IBM directly \nprocured worldwide came from suppliers that \nwarranted that the source was derived from \nsustainably managed forests. \nBiodiversity \nIn 2021, we established a global program \nfocused on creating, enhancing, or restoring \nhabitats for pollinators at IBM locations. In \naddition, we are extending the impact of our \nprogram to the communities where we operate \nthrough employee engagement. \n0.4 \n2.0 \n6.7 \n4.3* \n0.19** \nWater Conservation \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n% Annual reduction in water withdrawals \nat larger IBM locations in water-stressed \nregions (goal year-to-year reduction) \n*Restatement from prior year to reflect calculation correction. \n**2021 water withdrawals used to calculate the year-to-year change in withdrawals between 2022 and 2021 was adjusted to remove water use \nassociated with IBM\u2019s managed infrastructure services business which was spun off in November 2021. \nAt year-end 2022, 32 pollinator \ngardens were established at \nIBM locations globally versus \nour goal of 50 pollinator \ngardens by year-end 2023. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n*\nContents \nIntroduction \nGovernance \nSocial \nEnvironment \nAppendix",

These \nmaterials complement those previously developed \nfor establishing and maintaining pollinator gardens \nand have been shared with employees worldwide. \nIn addition, four IBM sites (IBM Corporate \nHeadquarters, New York; IBM Research Triangle \nPark, North Carolina; IBM Almaden Research \nCenter and IBM Silicon Valley Laboratory, both in \nCalifornia) have maintained WHC Conservation \nCertification for their wildlife habitat management \nand conservation education programs for decades, \nwith IBM Almaden Research Center receiving the \nfirst site certification in 1991. \nThird-Party Sustainability Certification \nfor Buildings \nIn 2021, we set a goal to pursue third-party \nsustainability certifications for major office \nconstruction and renovation projects greater than \n15,000 square feet or $5 million in project cost \nexecuted by IBM globally. In 2022, five projects \nreceived third-party certifications: \n1. Hyderabad, India (LEED Platinum) \n2. Bangalore, India (LEED Platinum) \n3. Hong Kong, China (LEED Gold) \n4. Shenzhen, China (LEED Gold & WELL Gold) \n5. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (LEED Gold & \nWELL Platinum) \nIncluding these projects, 29 projects at IBM-\nowned and leased locations are now certified to \na sustainability certification program. \nEcoTeams@IBM provides employees worldwide an opportunity to voluntarily lead and \nparticipate in activities that support ecosystem diversity and protection. \nSpan 64 IBM locations across 20 countries. \nIn 2022, participants completed approximately 80 activities, including learning events, tree \nplantings, beach clean ups, bike to work events, coral restoration, sea turtle conservation efforts, \nas well as maintaining pollinator gardens, bird boxes, and beehives. In addition, an internal working \ngroup was established amongst members to support our corporate pollinator garden goal and to \neducate employees about this global issue. \nPollution Prevention and \nWaste Management \nWe believe the best way to prevent pollution is \nto avoid the generation of waste at its source. \nFor waste that is generated, we minimize \npollution through a comprehensive and proactive \nwaste management program that calls for \nimplementation of the following practices, in order \nof preference: (1) reuse, (2) recycling, (3) recovery \n(e.g., waste-to-energy), (4) other treatment (e.g., \naqueous and chemical treatments, incineration), \nand (5) land disposal. \nNonhazardous Waste \nOur nonhazardous waste goal has two integral \ncomponents and encompasses IBM-owned \nlocations and leased locations of 100,000 square \nfeet or greater worldwide. \n1. Divert 90% or more (by weight) of our total \nnonhazardous waste from landfill and \nincineration by 2025, through reuse, recycling, \ncomposting, and waste-to-energy processes. \n2. Use waste-to-energy processes for no more \nthan 10% (by weight) of the diverted waste. \nIn 2022, reporting locations generated nearly \n14,800 MT of nonhazardous waste worldwide, \ndiverting 93.8% (by weight) from landfill or \nincineration, and meeting the first component of our \ngoal. Of the total amount diverted, however, 11.9% \n(by weight) was sent to waste-to-energy processes. \nWe continue to work toward reducing the amount \nof material sent to waste-to-energy processes to \nreduce this percentage to less than 10% and achieve \nthe second component of our goal. \nThe waste diversion results were achieved through \nproper management of end-of-life IT equipment, \nparts, and product scrap across IBM\u2019s global asset \nrecovery network; improved waste collection \ninfrastructure resulting in better sorting of waste; \npromotion of the IBM Furniture Donation Program \nfor employees and external organizations; and the \ncontinued focus on elimination of nonessential, \nsingle-use plastic items from our cafeterias.

In 2022, we continued our efforts with \nour largest cafeteria vendor (based on 2021 \nspend) and successfully eliminated or replaced \nall nonessential, single-use plastic items from 21 \nIBM-managed cafeterias operated by this vendor \nin the U.S., Latin America and Canada.1 Some \nexamples included replacing plastic knives, forks \nand spoons with metal or bamboo alternatives, \nand replacing plastic containers with paper-based \ncontainers. Collectively, these efforts eliminated \nthe annual use of approximately 11.9 MT (1.4 \nmillion items) of nonessential, single-use plastic \nitems. Our focus in 2023 will be engaging with our \nremaining cafeteria vendors. \nProduct Packaging \nA priority of our product design for the environment \nprogram is to develop products which can be shipped \nwith a minimum amount of packaging materials. \nBeyond that, whenever possible, we choose \npackaging materials that have fewer adverse impacts \non the environment, collaborating with suppliers \nto use recycled and recyclable materials and to \npromote reuse. \nBuilding upon our continuous efforts since the \n1980s to reduce the environmental impacts of \nour product packaging, we set a goal in 2021 to \neliminate nonessential plastic packaging from IBM \nlogo hardware products by year-end 2024. For \nessential plastic packaging, our goal is to ensure \nsuch packaging is designed to be 100% reusable, \nrecyclable, or compostable, or incorporates 30% or \nmore recycled content where technically feasible. \nWe identified 18 single-use plastic packaging \nelimination and material substitution projects for \nimplementation to meet the goal. 7 projects have \nbeen completed to date with 11 remaining. \nSingle-use plastic packaging elimination and material \nsubstitution projects completed in 2022 include: \nReplaced nonessential polybags (low density \npolyethylene [LDPE]) with paper envelopes to \nprotect publications shipped globally, avoiding an \nestimated 1.7 MT of polyethylene bags annually. \nReplaced zip-lock plastic bags (LDPE) with paper \nenvelopes for shipping documentation, avoiding \nan estimated 1 MT of zip-lock bags annually. \nReplaced air pillow void filler made from LDPE \nwith air pads that are made of 100% recycled \ncontent LDPE for storage systems shipments \nfrom Europe to destinations globally, avoiding an \nestimated 0.3 MT or 60 rolls of the virgin LDPE \nmaterial annually. \nReplaced polypropylene banding used for \nsecuring storage system products on pallets \nfor transport within Europe with polyethylene \nterephthalate banding, containing 30% recycled \ncontent, avoiding an estimated 0.3 MT of virgin \npolypropylene annually. \nReplaced LDPE stretch wrap used for securing \nrack and rack-less storage systems equipment \nto pallets for distribution to customers within \nEurope with a 100% recycled content LDPE \nstretch wrap, avoiding an estimated 0.4 MT of \nthe virgin LDPE wrap annually. \nOther projects involving packaging use efficiency \nand waste reduction were also implemented in \n2022. Two examples: \nThe IBM systems assembly plant in the U.S. \nintroduced a pallet reuse project. Empty wood \npallets from the assembly plant are returned \nto the local parts supplier for reuse in shipping \nnew components back to the assembly plant. \nThe pallets are painted green for tracking \npurposes and on average can be used twice \nsaving approximately 8 MT of timber annually. \nTo continue to minimize packaging waste in \nthe supply chain, we worked with a partner \nthat provides certain storage products to our \nassembly plant in Mexico to design packaging \nthat is then reused to ship the complete order to \ncustomers. The estimated annual avoidance is \n16 MT of packaging materials, including over 2.6 \nMT of LDPE materials. \n1The vendor previously removed all nonessential, single-use plastic items at IBM-managed cafeterias located in countries in the European Union (EU) in accordance with the \nEU Directive, 2019/904, on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment, and national implementing laws in Europe. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nContents \nIntroduction \nGovernance \nSocial \nEnvironment \nAppendix \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014",

When groundwater contamination \nwas first discovered at one of our sites in 1977, \nwe voluntarily initiated groundwater monitoring \nat our manufacturing and development locations \nworldwide. Today, we have more than 2,600 \nmonitoring wells and nearly 70 extraction wells in \nplace at our current and former locations. \nIn 2022, we operated remediation systems that \nremoved approximately 9,400 pounds of solvents \nfrom groundwater and soil vapor at three currently \noperating IBM locations and 11 former IBM \nlocations. We also have financial responsibility for \nremediation at one additional former location. \nUnder the U.S. Superfund law, we are involved in \nremediation activities at some third-party sites \nin the U.S. The Superfund law creates retroactive \nresponsibility for all parties that may have sent \nwaste or otherwise contributed to contamination \nat a site, regardless of whether the site\u2019s \noperations and/or the shipments of waste to that \nsite were legal, or even best practices, at the time. \nCurrently, we are participating in remediation \nactivities or bear some financial responsibility at \n18 Superfund sites. \nEnvironmental Goals for Suppliers \nIBM has long committed to doing business with \nsuppliers who conduct themselves with high \nstandards of ethical, environmental, and social \nresponsibility. We support this commitment not \nonly by setting specific environmental requirements \nfor our suppliers, but also by partnering with them \nto drive continual improvement. Since 2010, \nIBM has required first-tier suppliers to establish \ntheir own social and environmental management \nsystems, as well as set quantifiable goals in the \nareas of energy management, GHG emissions \nreduction, and waste management, and publicly \ndisclose progress toward those goals. \nIn 2021, we established the following additional \ngoals to help accelerate GHG emissions reduction \nin our supply chain and to encourage suppliers to \ntake ownership and build their capabilities across a \nbroad range of sustainability topics. \nRequire key suppliers in emissions-intensive \nbusiness sectors to set an emissions reduction \ngoal by 2022, addressing their Scope 1 and \nScope 2 GHG emissions, that is aligned with \nscientific recommendations from the UN IPCC \nto limit Earth\u2019s warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius \nabove pre-industrial levels. \n\u2022 As of year-end 2022, 96% of the key logistics, \nairline, hotel, production, and technology \nproduct suppliers in scope of IBM\u2019s goal \ndemonstrated that they have set GHG \nemissions reduction goals, addressing their \nScope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which are \naligned with scientific recommendations of the \nUN IPCC. The remaining 4% of suppliers are \nin the process of setting or updating their GHG \nemissions targets. We will continue to engage \nwith these suppliers and track the status of \ntheir goal setting process through completion. \nSupply Chain Environmental Responsibility \nEstablish, by year-end 2021, individual baselines \nfor fleet carbon intensity with each key carrier \nand shipment supplier involved with our product \ndistribution globally. Starting in 2022, convene \nwith each supplier to set a fleet carbon intensity \nreduction target covering the services they \nprovide to IBM. \n\u2022 In 2021, we engaged each of our key carrier \nand shipment suppliers to better understand \ntheir GHG emissions reduction programs \nand fleet carbon intensity baselines for their \nrespective logistics operations.
