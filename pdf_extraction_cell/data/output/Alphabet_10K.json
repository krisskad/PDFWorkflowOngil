We do not intend our\nuse or display of other companies' trade names or trademarks to imply an endorsement or sponsorship of us by such\ncompanies, or any relationship with any of these companies.\nPART I\nITEM 1.\nBUSINESS\nOverview\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter, \"Google is not a conventional company.\nWe do not intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring\nus to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots. It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016,\nan AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet's structure is\nabout helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.\nAccess and Technology for Everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world\u2019s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and\nsmall. Our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant\ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find\nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done.\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools\nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information\nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year.\nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant\noffers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a\nperson's day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today\u2019s business challenges, improve\nproductivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products\nand features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $150 billion\nin research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\nMaking AI Helpful for Everyone\nAI is a transformational technology that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across\nthe world, and for our business. At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for more than a\ndecade and making them available to our users. Our journey began in 2001, when machine learning was first\nincorporated into Google Search to suggest better spellings to users searching the web. Today, AI in our products is\n4.",

This led to the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT, in 2019 that helped\nSearch understand the intent of user search queries better than ever before.\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including\nGoogle Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, to help organizations stay at the forefront of AI innovation with our AI-\noptimized infrastructure, mature AI platform and world-class models, and assistive agents.\nWe believe AI can solve some of the hardest societal, scientific and engineering challenges of our time. For\nexample, in 2020, Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge. Since then, we\nhave open-sourced to the scientific community 200 million of AlphaFold\u2019s protein structures which are used to work on\neverything from accelerating new malaria vaccines to advancing cancer drug discovery and developing plastic-eating\nenzymes. As another example, AI can also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful\ninformation, predicting climate-related events, and optimizing climate action. Using advanced AI and geospatial\nanalysis, Google Research has developed flood forecasting models that can provide early warning and real-time\nflooding information to communities and individuals.\nAs AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features to our users and customers as we\ndeliver on our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful. With a bold\nand responsible approach, we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone.\nDeliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI with models that are developed, trained, and\nrigorously tested at scale powered by our continued investment in AI technical infrastructure. In December 2023, we\nlaunched Gemini, our most capable and general model. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means\nit can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information, including text,\ncode, audio, images, and video. Our teams across Alphabet will leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we have\npreviously developed and announced, across our business to deliver the best product and service experiences for our\nusers, advertisers, partners, customers, and developers.\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that\nmaximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI Principles. We published\nthese in 2018, as one of the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use, users, safety, and avoidance\nof harms above business considerations. While there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible, we\nbelieve it is possible \u2014 and in fact critical \u2014 to embrace that tension productively.\nEnable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\nAI is not only a powerful enabler, it is also a major platform shift. Globally, businesses from startups to large\nenterprises, and the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on\nmaking it easy and scalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing the most advanced\ncomputing infrastructure and expanding access to Google\u2019s latest AI models that have been rigorously tested in our\nown products. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, augment, and deploy applications using\ngenerative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and Conversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides\npre-packaged AI agents that assist developers to write, test, document, and operate software.\nImprove Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\nThings that we now consider routine \u2013 like spell check, mobile check deposit, or Google Search, Google\nTranslate, and Google Maps \u2013 all use AI. As AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features\nto our users as we continue to deliver on our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally\naccessible and useful.\nWhile we have been integrating AI into our products for years, we are now embedding the power of generative AI\nto continue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, Duet AI in Google Workspace\nhelps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings. Bard allows users to collaborate\nwith experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support, and app integration. Dream\nScreen, a new experimental feature in YouTube, allows for the creation of AI-generated video or image backgrounds to\nShorts by typing an idea into a prompt.\n5.",

With Performance Max, advertisers simply tell us their campaign\ngoals and share their creative assets, and AI will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across\nall of Google\u2019s properties, to meet their budget. Product Studio brings the benefits of AI to businesses of all sizes,\nhelping them easily create uniquely-tailored imagery featuring their products \u2014 for free. Additionally, we are\nexperimenting with Search and Shopping ads that are directly integrated into the AI-powered snapshot and\nconversational mode in Search Generative Experience.\nBuild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on\ntop of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built around AI, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, such as\nBest Take, Magic Editor, and Audio Magic Eraser. As we look ahead, we are designing our Android and Chrome\noperating systems with new AI-forward user experiences.\nMoonshots\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not\nevolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome,\nbut those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser.\nOur early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to\nfuture developments. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the\napplication of AI to our products and services, as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As we\nsaid in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as they\nare the key to our long-term success.\nPrivacy and Security\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are\nnear-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default;\nstrictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that\nput people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete\ntheir data, giving them tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-\nphishing, and password security features.\nGoogle\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\nGoogle Services\nServing Our Users\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people\nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized\nin the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, Google\nDrive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by users\naround the world.\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago. While\nGoogle Search started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical\nadvancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience.\nWe first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller\nscreens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple content\ntypes, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search modalities,\nlike voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive ways. We took\nthat a step further with multisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time. Large language\nmodels like BERT and Multitask Unified Models, or MUMs, have made it possible to express more natural language\nqueries, vastly improving the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people to\nfind what they are looking for.\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery\nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are\nconsuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music,\n6.",

Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people\naround the world to create and find great digital content.\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices. That is why we continue to\ninvest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well\nas growing our family of devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier\nby combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices,\nsuch as the new Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, and the Pixel Watch 2. Creating products and services that people rely on\nevery day is a journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\nHow We Make Money\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital\nmarketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide\nrange of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads\nat the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our\nadvertising business for more than a decade. Products like Performance Max and Product Studio use the full power of\nour AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities.\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears\non Google Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network\nproperties\"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of\nadvertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\u2022\nPerformance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct\nengagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving\nmeasurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n\u2022\nBrand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services,\nthrough videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand\nadvertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing\ncampaigns.\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web.\nWe focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering\nout invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and\nvideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\nIn addition, Google Services increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising,\nincluding:\n\u2022\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV,\nYouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n\u2022\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\nand\n\u2022\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices.\nGoogle Cloud\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates revenues primarily\nfrom consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools and other cloud\nservices. Customers use five key capabilities from Google Cloud.\n\u2022\nAI-optimized Infrastructure: provides open, reliable, and scalable compute, networking, and storage to\nenable customers to run workloads anywhere \u2014 on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be\nused to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serve various types of AI models.\n\u2022\nCybersecurity: helps customers detect, protect, and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats, with AI\nintegrated to further strengthen security outcomes, prioritize which threats to investigate, and identify attack\npaths, as well as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats.\n\u2022\nDatabases and Analytics: provides a variety of different types of databases \u2014 relational, key-value, in-\nmemory \u2014 to store and manage data for different types of applications.

Alphabet\u2019s\ninvestment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from\nthose in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become\nthriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own\nboards with independent members and outside investors.

Sustainability is one of our\ncore values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on\nsustainability and climate change since Google\u2019s founding more than 25 years ago.\nOur sustainability work is focused on empowering individuals to take action, working together with our partners\nand customers, and working to reduce our carbon footprint across our operations and supply chain.\nIn 2020, we shared our aspiration to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce one gigaton of\ntheir carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. This is an ambitious vision that we have set to push us to\ncontribute meaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain.\nIn 2021, we set an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, by\n2030. To accomplish this, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3\nabsolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based\ncarbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We have formally committed to the Science Based\nTargets initiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target.\nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our operations is transitioning to clean energy. Since 2017, we\nhave matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an\nannual basis. However, because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind\nacross the regions where we operate\u2014and because of the variable supply of these resources\u2014we still need to rely on\ncarbon-emitting energy sources that power local grids. That is why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy\n(CFE) on every grid where we operate by 2030.\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path\nto net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where\nthey involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we\nexpect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish 120% of the freshwater\nvolume we consume, on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030 and to help restore and improve the\nquality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate.\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains. Our\ncircularity principles focus on designing out waste from the start, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and\npromoting healthy materials\u2014for our data centers, workplaces, and products.\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including\nGoogle\u2019s Environmental Report. The contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. For additional information about\nrisks and uncertainties applicable to our commitments to attain certain sustainability goals, see Item 1A Risk Factors of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCulture and Workforce\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and\nencourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees\ncan have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to\ntake care of the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and\ndevelopment, resources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive\ncompensation programs help us to attract and retain top candidates, and we will continue to invest in recruiting talented\npeople to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality training and\nsupport to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities-\u2013ranging from courses for new managers, to learning\nresources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\nAt Alphabet, we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a\nworkforce that is representative of the users we serve.

Reduced spending by advertisers, a\nloss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize\nads could harm our business.\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers,\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value\n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective\nmonetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as\nour initiatives to phase out third-party cookies, as well as changes to other companies\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy\npractices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition,\ntechnologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether,\nand some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability\nand functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively\nand competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and\noperating results.\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are\nuseful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing\ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully,\nwe must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services,\nand technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a\nwider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and\nR&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products, and services.\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international\ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer\noperating histories and well-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources\nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic\narrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent; initiating intellectual property\nand competition claims (whether or not meritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and\ncontent providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to\naggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our\ncompetitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the\nneed for products and services before we do.\nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to\nintegrate AI capabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly\nevolving, and require significant investment, including development and operational costs, to meet the changing needs\nand expectations of our existing users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI technologies critical for our\nproducts and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and pricing of third-party equipment\nand technical infrastructure. Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or\nsuperior to our technologies or more cost-effective to deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the future may\nobtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our\nown AI products and services.\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the\nevolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers.

The investments that we are making across our businesses, such\nas building AI capabilities into new and existing products and services, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and\nprovide products and services that are helpful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our\ninvestments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in\npursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities.

We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud\ncomputing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the\nsame time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are\ncompetitive and constantly evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business\nobjectives. Further, our business with public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory\ncompliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or\nany deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may\nrequire us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in other\ncountries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements.\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among\nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and\nour offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be\nable to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, legal,\nregulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services.\nBecause all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and\nofferings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we may experience downward pressure on our\noperating margin in the future.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the\ndevices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines\nin advertiser spending; competition; customer usage and demand for our products; decreases in our pricing of our\nproducts and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services.\nIn addition, we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors,\nsuch as an increase in the mix of lower-margin products and services, in particular from the continued expansion of our\nbusiness into new fields, including products and services such as our devices, Google Cloud, and consumer\nsubscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those\nwe generate from advertising.

Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and\nmay not correlate to changes in revenue.

Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products,\nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country\nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have\ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for\nour innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have\nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the\npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or\nunenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and\nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting\nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word\n\u201cGoogle\u201d could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word \u201csearch.\u201d Some courts have\nruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S.,\nmay reach a different determination.

Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant\nmarket power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable\ncompanies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers\nhave taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user\naccess to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our\nofferings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors\npreferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet\naccess providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For\nexample, in 2018 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit\ninternet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In\naddition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or\nblockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or\ncontent providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby\nnegatively affecting our business.\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm\nour business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to\nexpand our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our\nintroduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws\nand regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new\nlaws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition,\nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) requirements, AI, and online content. The costs of compliance with these\nmeasures are high and are likely to increase in the future.\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a\nmanner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and\nservices, altered business practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and\nservices, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability.

Google finding that Google\nviolated antitrust laws related to Google Play's billing practices. The presiding judge will determine remedies in 2024\nand the range of potential remedies vary widely. We plan to appeal. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice, various\nU.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our\nadvertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the operation and\ndistribution of the Android operating system and Play Store. Other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the\nworld, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have challenged\nand may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are cooperating\nwith these investigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate.\nVarious laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have involved in the past,\nand may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing\nobligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, including\ndivestiture, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business,\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nAny of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity\nand other harms to our business. Estimating liabilities for our pending proceedings is a complex, fact-specific, and\nspeculative process that requires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may be less than or\nexceed our estimates. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in,\nadditional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nFor additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject, see Legal\nProceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPrivacy, data protection, and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure\nor alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and\noperating results.\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals\nconcerning data protection, data usage, and encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation\nhave resulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have\nhad and could continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and operating results. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and\ncompliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products and\nservices in ways that harm our business. Examples of these laws include:\n\u2022\nThe General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, which\napply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom, respectively, or\nrelated to products and services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers, respectively, or\nthe monitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.\n\u2022\nVarious comprehensive U.S. state and foreign privacy laws, which give new data privacy rights to their\nrespective residents (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting\nfrom our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose\nsignificant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.\n\u2022\nState laws governing the processing of biometric information, such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy\nAct and the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, which impose obligations on businesses that\ncollect or disclose consumer biometric information.\n\u2022\nVarious federal, state, and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to\nchildren and minors, including the collection and processing of children and minor\u2019s data. These include the\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, and the United Kingdom Age-Appropriate Design Code, all of\nwhich address the use and disclosure of the personal data of children and minors and impose obligations on\nonline services or products directed to or likely to be accessed by children.\n\u2022\nThe California Internet of Things Security Law, which regulates the security of data used in connection with\ninternet-connected devices.\n\u2022\nThe EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data\nacross certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among\nother changes.\n20.",

The validity of various data transfer mechanisms we\ncurrently rely upon remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., which\nmay require us to adapt our existing arrangements.\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend,\nresult in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to\nuse certain technologies.\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations\nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and\ntrademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts\nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-\nholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against\nus. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and\nmay continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies.\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing\nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or\nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain\njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues\nfor us and otherwise harm our business.\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property\ninfringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant\ndamages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the\nuse of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of\nrevenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when\nobtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property\ninfringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to\nprovide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims.\nRegardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. To\nthe extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and service offerings,\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nExpectations relating to ESG considerations could expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, and\nreputational harm.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those\nrelated to matters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and\ninternational accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are\nbeing developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven\nframeworks and/or disclosure requirements. We have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting\nframeworks and principles, and announced a number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and\ninitiatives may require considerable investments, and our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in\ncertain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious, and may change. We\ncannot guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at all, and projects\nthat are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to\nadhere to our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and regulations, or meet\nevolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation, financial condition,\nand operating results.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.\nOur effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with\ndifferent statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk\nmanagement program, changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the\nvaluation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax\nlaws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws).

As a result, we have\nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such\nas transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit\ncould harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject\nus to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income\ntaxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our\nestimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements\nand may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions\nmay be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. For\nexample, various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital\nservices taxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax\nregimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is coordinating negotiations among\nmore than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies,\nincluding the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. Our effective tax rate and cash tax\npayments could increase in future years as a result of these changes.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-\nterm stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could\ndiminish our cash reserves.\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares.\nFurther, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves\nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has\nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2023, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 86.5% of our\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common\nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder\napproval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our\ncompany or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no voting rights\n(except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based acquisition\ntransactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey\u2019s current relative voting\npower and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of\nour stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also affect Larry and\nSergey\u2019s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders\u2019 ability to\ninfluence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which\ncould reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that\nstockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in Alphabet\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a\nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nOur Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of\nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\n\u2022\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding\na stockholders' meeting.\n\u2022\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of\nminority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n22.",

As a result,\ncomparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis\nmay not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance.\nConsequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution,\nand other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy\nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect\nto continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic arrangements,\nwhich could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and\nother strategic arrangements;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions\nplaced upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or\notherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including\ncultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology;\n\u2022\nimplementation of controls (or remediation of control deficiencies), procedures, and policies at the acquired\ncompany;\n\u2022\nintegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of\nproduct, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022\ntransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\n\u2022\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and\nto address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u2022\nfailure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments, joint ventures,\nand other strategic arrangements;\n\u2022\nfailure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\n23.",

Discussion of 2022 results\ncompared to 2021 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2022 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nUnderstanding Alphabet\u2019s Financial Results\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For additional\ninformation on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate\nthat they will continue to affect our future results:\n\u2022\nUsers' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\nThe continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since\ninception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower\npace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may\naffect our revenues.\n\u2022\nUsers continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which\nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones,\nwearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or\nwhat they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to\nmaintain and grow our business.\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising\nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues\nmay be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market\nsaturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow\nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic\nmix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product\nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n\u2022\nAs online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our\nmonetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to\nexpand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example,\nrevenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also\nexpect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our\nmonetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then\non monetization.\n\u2022\nAs users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets\ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange\nrates affect such revenues.\n29.",

        "content": "Table of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S.,\nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our\nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased\nrevenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these\nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as\ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program\ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues\nand earnings.\n\u2022\nThe revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.\nRevenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics\nthan our advertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding\nour products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins\non our advertising revenues. For example, sales of our devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to\npressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\n\u2022\nAs we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and\ncapital expenditures.\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to\ndevelop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our\nbusinesses. We also expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including\nservers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in\nparticular in support of AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the\nbreadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong\npartnerships around strategic initiatives.\n\u2022\nWe continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits,\ninvestigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and\nfinancial results.\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide\nrange of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in\nfines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may\nincrease, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we may\nneed to change our business practices to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters. Examples include the\nantitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General; legislative\nproposals and pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor\nprotection for websites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various\nlegislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms. For additional information, see Item 1A Risk\nFactors and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022\nOur employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring\ntalented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information,\nsee Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and devices; and fees received for\nconsumer subscription-based products. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed above, fluctuations in our\nrevenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by a combination of general factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n30.",

For\nthe years ended December\u00a031, 2022 and 2023, our depreciation on property and equipment were $13.5 billion and\n$11.9 billion, respectively.\nLeases\nFor the years ended December\u00a031, 2022 and 2023, we recognized total operating lease assets of $4.4 billion and\n$2.9 billion, respectively. As of December\u00a031, 2023, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases,\nwhich had a weighted average remaining lease term of eight years, was $17.7 billion, of which $3.2 billion is short-term.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future short-term and long-\nterm lease payments of $657\u00a0million and $3.3 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThese leases will commence between 2024 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years.\nFor the years ended December\u00a031, 2022 and 2023, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs)\nwere $3.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the years ended December\u00a031,\n2022 and 2023. For additional information, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in\nItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancing\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December\u00a031, 2023, we had no commercial\npaper outstanding.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2023, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2024 and\n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using\ncertain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have\nbeen borrowed under the credit facilities.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2023, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion\nwith short-term and long-term future interest payments of $214\u00a0 million and $3.6\u00a0 billion, respectively. For additional\ninformation, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure and\ndevices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then supply\nthese components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of these\narrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be presented as\nfinancing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-\nK.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring 2023 we repurchased and subsequently retired 528 million shares for $62.2 billion.\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0\nbillion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2023, $36.3 billion remains available for Class A and\nClass C share repurchases.\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nShares\nAmount\nShares\nAmount\nClass A share repurchases\n61 $\n6,719\u00a0\n78 $\n9,316\u00a0\nClass C share repurchases\n469\n52,577\u00a0\n450\n52,868\u00a0\nTotal share repurchases\n530 $\n59,296\u00a0\n528 $\n62,184\u00a0\nShares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of December\u00a031, 2023.\nFor additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(1)\n(1) \n42.",

On September 14, 2022, the General\nCourt reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1\u00a0billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of\nJustice.\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.

As\npermitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have\nlong-term taxes payable of $6.3 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December\u00a031, 2023.\nPurchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations\nAs of December\u00a0 31, 2023, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $45.9\nbillion, of which $31.6 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical\ninfrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to\ncommitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory and network capacity. For those agreements\nwith variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as\nof December\u00a0 31, 2023. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the\nexpected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note\n10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and\nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar\ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and\nare not readily determinable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make\nestimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of\nuncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from\nour estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under\nthe circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical accounting\nestimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nFor a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements, see Note 1 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-\nmarketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the\nmeasurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments\nresulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments\nrequire quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs.\nAdjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of\nestimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the\ncompanies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of\nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market\napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount\nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others.\n43.",

We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use\nof unobservable inputs.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when\nother changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use\nand utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we\nexpect to benefit from the assets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable\nand resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions\nperiodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as\nwell as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our\nuncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. To\nthe extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect\nthe provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the\nrelated net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns\nby the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of\nadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for\nincome taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and\nconsent orders involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters include\nspeculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is\nprobable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is\nreasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has\nbeen previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments\nand changes to our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated\namount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in\nexcess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment resulting\nin a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years. This change in\naccounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.

International revenues, as well as costs and expenses\ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the\nU.S. dollar. As discussed below, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal\ncurrencies hedged included the Australian dollar,\u00a0 British pound, Canadian dollar,\u00a0 Euro, and Japanese yen. For the\npurpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange\nrates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be\nexperienced.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and\nliabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E, which are offset\nby the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have\nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $136 million and $503 million as of\nDecember\u00a031, 2022 and 2023, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for\nthe years ended December\u00a031, 2022 and 2023.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a\ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option\ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings.\u00a0When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign\ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging\ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate\nthese contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot\nrate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them\ninto revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December\u00a031, 2022 and 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to\nour cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion lower as of\nDecember\u00a031, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a\ncorresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency\nrisks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency\ntranslation risk from our foreign operations.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI\nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $903 million and $946 million\nlower as of December\u00a031, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to\noffset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and\nmaintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities,\nmortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate\nderivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and\nfloating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair\nmarket value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income\nthan predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to\ninterest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt\nsecurities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We measure\nsecurities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until\nthe securities are sold, less any expected credit losses.\n45.",

The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our\ninvestment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95%\nconfidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December\u00a031, 2022\nand 2023 are shown below (in millions):\n\u00a0\nAs of December 31,\n12-Month Average \n\nAs of December 31,\n\u00a0\n2022\n2023\n2022\n2023\nRisk category - interest rate\n$\n256\u00a0 $\n296\u00a0 $\n198\u00a0 $\n271\u00a0\nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the\nsensitivity analyses performed as of December\u00a0 31, 2022 and 2023 due to the inherent limitations associated with\npredicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is\nnot intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that\ncould substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are\ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily\ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and\nrepresent $5.2 billion and $6.0 billion of our investments as of December\u00a0 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. A\nhypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December\u00a0 31, 2023 balance would decrease the fair value of\nmarketable equity securities by $597 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market price\nrisk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the\nmeasurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the\nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are\ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which\ncould result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity investments in\nprivate companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable\ntransactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions could result in\nadditional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood\nof our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public offerings,\nacquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity securities may\nnot directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December\u00a031, 2022 and 2023, the\ncarrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement alternative,\nwas $28.5 billion and $28.8 billion, respectively.\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion as of\nDecember\u00a031, 2022 and 2023, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments\ncould be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n46.",

In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained,\nin all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO\ncriteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated January 30, 2024\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a\nmaterial weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst\u00a0& Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 30, 2024\n50.",

        "content": "Table of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nAlphabet Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became\nthe successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales\nof other products and services, such as fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app\npurchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses; contingent liabilities; fair values of\nfinancial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others.\nWe base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the\nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain\nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those\nplaced in service during the year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in\ndepreciation expense of $3.9 billion and an increase in net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.24 per basic and $0.24 per\ndiluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and\nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other\nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues.\nAdvertising Revenues\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n\u2022\nGoogle Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners\nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n\u2022\nYouTube properties; and\n\u2022\nGoogle Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google\nDisplay & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for\nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues\nwhen the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on\na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed\non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues,\n56.",

Where we are the principal, we\ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to\nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being\nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\n\u2022\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such YouTube TV, YouTube\nMusic and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n\u2022\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n\u2022\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\n\u2022\nother products and services.\nSubscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report\nrevenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to\nfacilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee.\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\n\u2022\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform,\nand other services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, analytics,\nand AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Duet AI for Google Cloud;\n\u2022\nGoogle Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for\nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Duet AI in Google\nWorkspace; and\n\u2022\nother enterprise services.\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract\nterms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when\nthe customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services\nprovided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes\nthe benefits of the cloud services.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate\nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine\nstandalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration.\nWe estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We\nbelieve that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\nSales Commissions\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We\nrecognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year.\nThese costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\u2022\nTAC includes:\n\u25e6\namounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services.\nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers,\nand software developers; and\n\u25e6\namounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n57.",

As a result, development costs\nthat meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software\napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were\nnot material for the periods presented.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity\nclassified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense\nusing the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be\npaid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and\nthe income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include market\nconditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and certain\nawards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service\nperiod. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through\nsettlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the respective\nOther Bet company.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended\nDecember\u00a031, 2021,\u00a02022, and 2023, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $7.9 billion, $9.2\nbillion, and $8.7 billion, respectively.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain\ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result\nin expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of\nunobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&E.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that\nis determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based\non the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets.\n58.",

Where applicable,\nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate\nvaluation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents,\nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and\nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\nWe measure certain other instruments, including SBC awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and\ncertain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative\nfinancial instruments and accounts receivable.\nCredit Risks\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial\ninstruments, including foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure\nthrough timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management.\nForeign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts\nreceivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We\nmanage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the\namount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\nCash Equivalents\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-\nbacked securities, time deposits, and money market funds.\nMarketable Securities\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable\ndebt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified\nand accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward\nobjectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective maturities. As\nwe view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities\nbeyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We\ncarry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of\nstockholders\u2019 equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded in OI&E. For\ncertain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value are recorded in\nOI&E. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification\nmethod, and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E.\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses,\nincluding unrealized, recognized in OI&E. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up\nrestrictions beyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNon-Marketable Securities\nNon-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities\nthrough which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. All\nother non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative.\nUnder the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus\n59.",

The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or\nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\nAdditionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the\ncustomer.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements\nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics\nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status\nand make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider\ncustomer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions.\nOther\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into\ncommercial arrangements at or near the same time. For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the\nsubstance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be\naccounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value of the components of the\narrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally, if our investment in such companies becomes\nimpaired, any remaining performance obligations would be reassessed and may be reduced.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is\nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E,\nnot to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If\nwe have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized\nloss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the\ncorresponding charge as a component of OI&E.\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among\nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair\nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the\nfair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\nInventory\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are\nthe primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses\n60.",

If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a\nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination\nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets,\nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices,\ndata centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network\nequipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet\nbeen placed in service.\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated.\nWe depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over\na period of six years for servers and network equipment. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the\nremaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information technology\nassets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our intended use.\nGoodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate\nour reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting\nunits, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least\nannually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill\nimpairments were not material for the periods presented.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily\ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease\npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets\nand liabilities.\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the\nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and\npayments for maintenance and utilities.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments,\nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base,\nnon-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid\nlease payments and lease incentives.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is\nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease\nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed\nat the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by\ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected\n61.",

If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is\nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of\nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax\nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our\ndeferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets\nwhen it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax\nassets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the\nglobal intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on\ntechnical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the\nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be\nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the\npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values,\nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nForeign Currency\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange\nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for\nrevenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders\u2019\nequity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction\ncurrency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280):Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and\nincome taxes paid.

We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as\nrevenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related\ndeferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts\nwith an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including\namounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions,\nplatforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December\u00a031, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.4 billion was\nrecognized as revenues for the year ended December\u00a031, 2023.\nNote 3.

Variable Interest Entities\nConsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of operations\nand financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2022 and 2023, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.1 billion\nand $4.9 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.6 billion and\n$2.5 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other\nBets.\nTotal noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion as of\nDecember\u00a031, 2022 and 2023, respectively, of which $1.1 billion is redeemable noncontrolling interest (RNCI) for both\nperiods. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\nwas not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further\ndetails on OI&E.\nUnconsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies\nthat are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power\ngeneration using renewable sources.\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account\nfor these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these unconsolidated\nVIEs were $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, as of December\u00a0 31, 2022 and $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion,\nrespectively, as of December\u00a031, 2023.

Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nWe have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $10.6\u00a0billion as\nof December 31, 2023, of which the majority is paid over seven years ending in the first quarter of 2030.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers\nof Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to defend\nand/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of\nintellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the\ntime within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into\nindemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to\nour agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations,\ncash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future\npayments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows\nin a particular period.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2023, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect\nthe amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses\ndisclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine\nboth the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be\nunable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are\ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a\nmaterial adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\n77.",

The EC decision imposed a \u20ac2.4 billion\n($2.7 billion as of June\u00a027, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and\non September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's\ndecision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the\nGeneral Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January\n20, 2022.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related distribution\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June\u00a030,\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and\non October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14,\n2022, the General Court reduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1\u00a0billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the\nEuropean Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1\u00a0 billion for the fine, which we reduced by\n$217\u00a0million in 2022.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google\nhad with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5\nbillion ($1.7 billion as of March\u00a020, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements,\nwhich we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge\nof $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their\nnature we cannot estimate a possible loss, include:\n\u2022\nIn August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search\nand Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further, in\nJune 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\u2022\nOn December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally,\non January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google\u2019s digital advertising technology\nproducts violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General\njoined the complaint. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's\nadvertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively.\nOn June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that\nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on\nDecember 1, 2023.\n\u2022\nOn July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement in\nprinciple with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the\ntrial date with the states, and any final approval of the settlement is expected to occur in 2024. In May 2022,\nthe EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business practices. Korean regulators are\ninvestigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with\nthe new app store billing regulations.\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to\ncooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\n78.",

        "content": "Table of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\nPrivacy Matters\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and\nlitigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information and\nadvertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result\nin a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on\nimportation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into\nthe U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims,\nand may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our\ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions\nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment,\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using\nour platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, in December 2023, a California\njury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's\nbusiness. The presiding judge will determine remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. We\nplan to appeal. We also periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law.\nThese claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could\nresult in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other\nadverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The\nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the\nsale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue\nnon-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when\na loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of\nloss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of\nthese matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our\nexpectations.\nSee, Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\n79.",

Stockholders' Equity\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C\ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect\nto voting. Each share of Class\u00a0A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock\nis entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law.\nShares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically\nconvert upon sale or transfer to Class\u00a0A common stock.\nShare Repurchases\nIn the years ended December\u00a0 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, we repurchased $50.3 billion, $59.3\u00a0 billion, and\n$62.2\u00a0billion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional\n$70.0\u00a0billion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December\u00a031, 2023, $36.3 billion remains available for Class A\nand Class C share repurchases.\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nShares\nAmount\nShares\nAmount\nClass A share repurchases\n61 $\n6,719\u00a0\n78 $\n9,316\u00a0\nClass C share repurchases\n469\n52,577\u00a0\n450\n52,868\u00a0\nTotal share repurchases\n530 $\n59,296\u00a0\n528 $\n62,184\u00a0\nShares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of December\u00a031, 2023.\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general\nbusiness and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately\nnegotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration\ndate.\nNote 12. Net Income Per Share\nWe compute net income per share of Class\u00a0A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive\nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable\nshares. The dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings\nper share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class\u00a0A\nstock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not\nassume the conversion of those shares.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class\u00a0A, Class B, and Class C stock\nare identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of\nincorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per\nshare dividends on our Class\u00a0A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to\nour certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a\ngiven class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In\naddition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it\nmust be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each\nyear are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class\u00a0A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the\nearnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed\nearnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.\nIn the\u00a0years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, the net income per share amounts are the same for\nClass\u00a0A, Class B, and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or\ndistributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\n(1)\n(1) \n80.",

Significant judgment is required in evaluating\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax\nbenefits was $5.2 billion, $7.1 billion, and $9.4 billion as of December\u00a031, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, of which\n$3.7 billion, $5.3 billion, and $7.4 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively.\nAs of December\u00a0 31, 2022 and 2023, we accrued $346\u00a0 million and $622 million in interest and penalties in\nprovision for income taxes, respectively.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two\nmajor tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax\nreturns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2021 tax returns. We\nhave also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent\nestablishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.\nThe tax years 2016 through 2022 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for\nIrish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial\nstatements.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the\nadequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax\nauthorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nHowever, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are\nresolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for\nincome taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is\nnot certain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S.\ntax positions could decrease by approximately $700\u00a0 million in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved\ninclude various U.S. and non-U.S. matters.\n85.",

Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees\nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and\nNFL Sunday Ticket; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\n\u2022\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for\nenterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and\nsubscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and\ncollaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\u2022\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from\nOther Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering\nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the\nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are\nallocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\nReflecting DeepMind's increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in\nthe first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet-level activities instead of within Other Bets.\nAdditionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation methodologies to\nprovide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have been recast to\nconform to the current presentation.\nAs announced on April 20, 2023, we brought together part of Google Research (the Brain team) and DeepMind to\nsignificantly accelerate our progress in artificial intelligence (AI). The group, called Google DeepMind, is reported within\nAlphabet-level activities prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2023. Previously, the Brain team was included\nwithin Google Services.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities.

Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation,\nmanagement concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\u00a0 31, 2023.\nManagement reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and Compliance Committee. The effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting as of December\u00a031, 2023 has been audited by Ernst\u00a0 & Young LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item\u00a08 of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls\nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the\ndesired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there\nare resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible\ncontrols and procedures relative to their costs.\n88.",

(Alphabet), I am pleased to offer you a position as a member of Alphabet\u2019s Board of Directors (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d), subject to and commencing upon the approval of your appointment by the Board.\nAs compensation for your services to Alphabet, you will be granted an initial equity award of $1,000,000 in the form of Alphabet\nRestricted Stock Units (\u201cGSUs\u201d) on the first Wednesday of the month following your initial appointment. The exact number of\nGSUs comprising this grant will be calculated by dividing $1,000,000 by the average closing price of Alphabet Inc. Class C capital\nstock during the previous month , rounded to the nearest whole share. These GSUs will first vest 25% on your grant\u2019s one year\nanniversary. Thereafter your GSUs will vest 1/48th monthly until fully vested.\nFollowing each annual shareholder meeting, you will be eligible to receive annualized compensation of a $350,000 GSU grant and\na $75,000 cash retainer for the prior year of service. Note that your [CURRENT YEAR] awards will be prorated based upon the\ntime between your appointment date and the shareholder meeting. Shares and cash payments will be made the first Wednesday of\nthe month following each shareholder meeting. The exact number of GSUs comprising this grant will be calculated by dividing the\nGSU grant value by the average closing price of Alphabet\u2019s Class C stock during the calendar month preceding the month of the\ngrant . These GSUs will vest 1/48th monthly until fully vested.\nAt the time of vest, any vested GSUs will convert to Alphabet Class C shares. If the US financial markets are closed on a vesting\ndate, shares will vest on the next trading day. Vesting in GSUs is contingent on continued service on the Board on the applicable\nvesting dates. These awards and all future equity awards are subject to the terms and conditions of applicable plan documents and\naward agreements. Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Alphabet Directors are required to hold fully vested shares of\nAlphabet stock equal in value to at least $1,000,000 . New Directors have five years from the initial appointment to come into\ncompliance with these ownership requirements. Please note that ongoing compensation for service on the Board may be changed at\nany time at the discretion of the Board.\n For initial equity awards granted prior to February 2020, the exact number of GSUs comprising the grant was calculated by dividing $1,000,000\nby the closing price of Alphabet\u2019s Class C capital stock on the trading day immediately prior to the date of grant.\n For annual equity awards granted prior to February 2020, the exact number of GSUs comprising the grant was calculated by dividing $350,000\nby the closing price of Alphabet\u2019s Class C capital stock on the trading day immediately prior to the date of grant.\n Our Corporate Governance Guidelines were amended in April 2018 to increase the minimum stock ownership requirement for directors from\n$750,000 to $1,000,000.\n1\n2\n3\n1\n2\n3",
