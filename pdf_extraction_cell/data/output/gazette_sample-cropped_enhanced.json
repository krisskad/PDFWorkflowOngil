This notification supersedes a previous one and details the fee structure for various vehicle types, including cars, trucks, and heavy machinery. The fees are to be collected at specific toll plazas, with different rates applicable during and after the completion of the six-laning project. The document also specifies provisions for monthly passes, discounts for local commercial vehicles, and penalties for overloaded vehicles. The notification further includes details on the capital cost of the project and the process for annual revisions of the fee rates.",
      "detailed_summary": "This document, published in the Gazette of India, is a notification from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways concerning the collection of user fees on National Highway 8B in Gujarat. The notification references previous agreements and authorizations related to the highway section, including the entrustment of the road to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and a concession agreement with West Gujarat Expressway Limited for widening and maintenance. The BoT (Toll) Concession Agreement was terminated, and the NHAI took over the section. The notification details the fee structure for various vehicle types, differentiating between the construction period (six-laning) and after completion. Fees are calculated based on the base rate per kilometer, with adjustments for the length of the road section and equivalent structure length (bridges, flyovers). Table 1 provides the base rates for different vehicle categories. Table 2 specifies the location of toll plazas and the length for which fees are payable. Table 3 details the fee structure for structures. The document also includes provisions for monthly passes for local residents, discounts for commercial vehicles registered in the district, and penalties for overloaded vehicles. The notification also states that no user fee shall be levied for the delayed period between the Scheduled date of completion and the date of actual completion of the project. The document concludes with information on the estimated capital cost of the project and the process for annual revisions of the fee rates, which will be published in newspapers.",
