Notably, while Alphabet and the NASDAQ Composite tracked relatively closely until mid-2020, Alphabet subsequently pulled ahead significantly. The RDG Internet Composite initially outperformed all others in 2020 but then underperformed significantly from 2022 onward, suggesting Alphabet's business model proved more resilient than other internet companies."
