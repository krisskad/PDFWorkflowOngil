With more than 100 \nESG KPIs demanded from the regulator, the level of complexity and volume of \nESG-related data requirements will significantly increase for financial institutions.\nThe regulatory ESG landscape has advanced rapidly since the Paris Agreement in 2015, with \nan inevitable impact on financial institutions. For example, in one ambitious regulatory \ninitiative on sustainability, the ECB published a guide for banks on climate-related and envi­\nronmental risks. The EU is now aiming to accelerate regulatory momentum by introducing \nobligations on disclosure, which involve mandatory reporting standards and external assur­\nance in order to create transparency and harmonization of sustainability data. \nBoth the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the European Sustainabil­\nity Reporting Standards (ESRS) are driving the harmonization of sustainability data in the \nEU. While CSRD extends the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), compelling signifi­\ncantly more companies to disclose comprehensive ESG criteria, ESRS addresses and formu­\nlates CSRD requirements for in-scope entities. Given the high level of complexity and the \nvolume of ESG-related data requirements, these regulatory commitments will pose signifi­\ncant challenges for financial institutions and corporates. Indeed, CSRD/ESRS requires more \nthan 100 ESG key performance indicators (KPIs), obliging financial institutions not only to \nadjust reporting processes, but also to update their ESG strategies, governance and data \ncapabilities.\nOn 9th June 2023, an updated draft Delegated Act to supplement the earlier CSRD / ESRS \ndraft was issued asking companies to report against their material topics (amendments \nincluded some KPI adjustments from mandatory to voluntary and introduction of extended \nphase-in periods).\nHow EU Financial Institutions can \nPrepare for CSRD/ESRS\nNote: This document has been updated after the publication of the European Commission‘s draft Delegated Act on \nJune 9th.",

The \ntypes of KPIs that financial institutions need to submit across all dimensions follow a certain \npattern - including descriptions of policies, targets, action plans, transition plans and poten­\ntial financial impact. The proportion of quantitative or qualitative KPIs per thematic category \nvaries and depends on the type of information required.\nThe draft Delegated Act published by the European Commission includes certain measures \nto rationalize reporting obligations whilst retaining ambitious objectives.

These could potentially include fines, legal consequenc­\nes, or damage to reputation and business relationships.\nThe CSRD is a much broader directive than its predecessor, NFRD. It has introduced an audit \nrequirement, for which financial institutions need to prepare accordingly. This statutory audit \nrequirement applies for three main reasons: 1) More companies are affected by CSRD; 2) the \nCSRD/ESRS regulations demand additional information; and 3) CSRD/ESRS requires limit­\ned assurance on sustainability information, although the end goal is to move to reasonable \nassurance in the longer term.\nThe challenge of implementation for financial institutions\nOne of the main challenges for financial institutions is that CSRD/ESRS requirements have \nbeen written with corporates in mind. Bank-specific standards were expected to be published \nbefore the end of 2024, but recently EFRAG has decided to postpone sector-specific stan­\ndards and now plans to develop these under a “modified timetable”. It is anticipated that \nbank-specific standards will call for further KPIs, and potentially some additional guidance \non existing standards. That said, the current interpretation of standards is not likely to \nchange significantly. As a result, financial institutions should start preparing their data-cap­\nturing capabilities and develop their initial report according to certain hypotheses.\nKey hypotheses for banks to consider when setting out their CSRD/ESRS \nreporting objectives\nFinancial institutions need to integrate CSRD/ESRS requirements into their existing opera­\ntions. This involves not only strategy and steering, but also governance, risk management as \nwell as quantification and enablers. We have identified five critical hypotheses that financial \ninstitutions will need to consider when incorporating CSRD/ESRS reporting into their target \noperating model:\n1.\tTarget setting: Financial Institutions will need to disclose existing target KPIs – \nincreasing ESG transparency will drive FIs to set new targets\nCurrent targets of financial institutions focus almost exclusively on the climate change \ncomponent. CSRD/ESRS brings an increasing regulatory expectation on financial institu­\ntions to set targets beyond climate-related matters – including, for example biodiversity, \npollution as well as social and governance issues. In the first step, CSRD/ESRS requires \nfinancial institutions to publish those ESG targets that have already been set without hav­\ning to formulate new targets. However, with the increasing ESG momentum among other \ncompetitors in the market, it can be expected that this will lead financial institutions to \nformulate new ESG targets. These will need to be incorporated into strategies and pro­\ncesses and must be aligned to existing initiatives, such as carbon accounting.",

The exercise can also present an opportunity if handled correctly. For \nexample, the systematic collection and analysis of CSRD data from customers might lead \nto the identification and seizure of new business possibilities. \nFor instance, platform ecosystems can be established, in which financial institutions \nsupport clients as brokers for third-party services and actively engage in a dialogue on \ncustomer KPIs. For this purpose, innovations arising from cooperation with companies \nand startups should be integrated into the ecosystem. Finally, financial institutions can \nexpand their horizons away from simply capturing data. They can become data providers \nand methodology champions for CSRD KPIs that focus on the customer portfolio. It is \ncertainly true that clients expect financial institutions not just to focus on KPIs demanded \nby regulators, but also to engage in activities that benefit them directly.\n3.\tEstablishing governance structures: To institutionalize ESG reporting, ESG\ngovernance structures need to be critically reviewed \nFor the implementation of CSRD/ESRS reporting, departments across the entire organi­\nzation (including group sustainability, human resources, compliance and finance) will be \ninvolved. In comparison to a fragmented and siloed approach by individual business units, \nviews on all ESG topics from across the entire organization should be gathered. Given the \nincreasing volume of ESG-related regulations, a suitable governance structure should be \nput in place to manage the organization’s reporting and allow for comprehensive steering. \nThe governance structure would aim to identify responsibilities in the report generation \nprocess and support the interaction between various individuals and divisions, allowing \nfor a smooth reporting process. This should be supplemented by operational IT infrastruc­\nture and constant collaboration with internal and external auditors.\n4.\tAdopting a portfolio perspective: The role of banks as change agents goes beyond \nthe issue of climate to encompass a bank’s entire portfolio\nCSRD and ESRS regulations require extended information and explanations for more \nthan 20 KPIs, including information on activities within the value chain. For a financial in­\nstitution, this would mean that the entire portfolio of a bank would be subject to the ESRS \ndefinition of a value chain (see box below).\nAs regulators envisage financial institutions as change agents beyond just the issue of \nclimate change, the term “value chain” thus encompasses the entire portfolio. This line of \nargument is also supported by the EU taxonomy, which will require banks to calculate a \ngreen asset ratio according to a wide range of sustainability targets, including biodiversity, \npollution and circular economy. Moreover, from the perspective of the EU Corporate Due \nDiligence Directive, human rights issues must also be assessed along the entire value \nchain, and this also applies to financial institutions. \nESRS does allow for a phased approach for some value-chain KPIs (beyond carbon ac­\ncounting) of a maximum of three years. However, the data, methodology and calculations \nrequired for topics such as biodiversity and pollution will be just as complex as they have \nbeen for carbon accounting. Financial institutions must therefore get to grips with these \nissues early on in the CSRD/ESRS implementation.",

A value chain comprises the activities, \nresources, and relationships that the company uses and relies on to produce its products or services from conception \nthrough delivery, consumption, and end of life.”\n5.\tExpanding data capabilities: To meet CSRD/ESRS requirements, companies must \ndramatically boost their data capabilities\nTo fulfill CSRD/ESRS requirements, current capabilities (including methodology, data and \nsystems) need to be significantly upgraded in order to create a holistic ESG perspective. \nThe initial starting point here would be to define a target ESG reporting picture that re­\nsponds to additional reporting obligations when they arise. Companies need to expand ca­\npabilities because each KPI comprises various data points that reside in different systems \nacross the organization. To manage the increasing complexity of data points, in particular \nthose that cut across internal organizational boundaries, the introduction of tool-based \nsolutions to support ESG reporting processes should be considered.\nPractical implementation: our recommended approach \nTo assess CSRD/ESRS readiness and build a future ESG reporting target picture, we suggest \na three-step approach, which involves carrying out a gap analysis, conducting a materiality \nassessment and defining an implementation roadmap for execution.\nStep 1: Gap analysis to assess CSRD/ESRS readiness and develop a target picture\nTo assess CSRD/ESRS readiness and derive a clear view of the maturity of financial institu­\ntions’ ESG reporting, the latest sustainability report – if available – should be examined \nagainst upcoming CSRD/ESRS requirements. The aim of this analysis is to identify reporting \ngaps and to determine whether the current availability of data and the system landscape \nmeet future CSRD/ESRS reporting requirements. For a first outside-in assessment, KPIs can \nbe systematically analyzed from an operations perspective and then cross-checked against \npublished sustainability reports. \nAfter the initial gap assessment, financial institutions should develop concrete measures to \nresolve potential issues. This would include devising internal and external system solutions \nto support ESG reporting. To gauge readiness, the company should design a future gover­\nnance model based on the ESG target picture, and also define an implementation roadmap. \nStep 2: Materiality assessment: Financial institutions are obliged to conduct a double \nmateriality assessment for all KPIs, which can also be leveraged as a tool to capture stake­\nholders’ perspectives on ESG. Furthermore, such an assessment can inform ESG strategies \nand indicate where future investment may be required. Introduced by CSRD, the double \nmateriality assessment involves reporting from two angles: how ESG-related issues affect the \ncompany; and how the company’s own actions affect people and the environment.",

Third, the materiality survey \nand additional key stakeholder interviews should be carried out for a preliminary framing of \nthe materiality matrix. The last step of the assessment is to refine material by clustering ESG \nthemes and then produce the final materiality report. The assessment findings should in­\nform the implementation roadmap for the coming years.\nStep 3: Implementation based on a previously defined roadmap and matrix project \norganization\nDue to the ambiguity in regulatory guidance and the potential updates to follow, we recom­\nmend a phased implementation approach. The first phase of the implementation focuses on \nthose KPIs that already exist and are mandatory for the initial CSRD/ESRS reporting period. \nCurrently, these KPIs relate primarily to the financial institution’s operations as well as the \nclimate change portfolio.

      "executive_summary": "The CSRD and ESRS represent a major advancement in ESG regulations aimed at harmonizing sustainability reporting across Europe. These frameworks will be implemented in phases starting with large public-interest entities in 2024, followed by other large entities in 2025, and SMEs in 2026. Financial institutions face particular challenges as they must report against material topics across environmental, social, and governance dimensions, with both qualitative and quantitative KPIs required. The June 2023 draft Delegated Act introduced some flexibility with phase-in periods and voluntary disclosures for certain requirements.",
      "detailed_summary": "The white paper 'How EU Financial Institutions can Prepare for CSRD/ESRS' addresses the significant regulatory changes in sustainability reporting that EU financial institutions must prepare for. The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) are described as the 'gold standard' for ESG regulations, designed to harmonize sustainability reporting across Europe.\n\nThe CSRD extends and strengthens the existing Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), expanding its scope to include more companies and requiring reporting on a wider range of sustainability issues. It operates on the principle of 'double materiality,' requiring companies to report both how sustainability issues affect their business and how their activities impact society and the environment.\n\nImplementation will occur in phases: from 2024 for large public-interest entities already subject to NFRD (reporting in 2025); from 2025 for large listed and unlisted companies not currently subject to NFRD (reporting in 2026); and from 2026 for listed SMEs and small financial institutions (reporting in 2027, with a postponement option to 2029). Non-EU companies meeting certain criteria will also be subject to these requirements.\n\nThe ESRS, developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), provides operational guidance for companies implementing CSRD requirements. It covers 12 different standards across environmental, social, and governance dimensions, including climate change, biodiversity, social issues, and governance matters.\n\nOn June 9, 2023, the European Commission published a draft Delegated Act that introduced more flexibility, including voluntary disclosure of certain data points and phase-in periods for specific requirements. This allows companies to gradually implement the more complex aspects of the reporting standards.\n\nThe regulations require granular qualitative and quantitative KPIs across ten categories. Companies will need to report against their material topics, with requirements including descriptions of policies, targets, action plans, transition plans, and potential financial impacts. The draft Delegated Act allows for phasing in certain requirements after the first year's disclosure and makes some disclosures voluntary or more flexible.\n\nA particular challenge for financial institutions is that CSRD/ESRS requirements were written primarily with corporates in mind. Bank-specific standards were expected by the end of 2024, but EFRAG has postponed sector-specific standards under a 'modified timetable.' These standards are expected to require additional KPIs and guidance.\n\nThe CSRD also introduces an audit requirement, requiring limited assurance on sustainability information initially, with plans to move to reasonable assurance in the longer term. Non-compliance could result in fines, legal consequences, or damage to reputation and business relationships.",
