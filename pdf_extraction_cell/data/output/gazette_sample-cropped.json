The BoT (Toll) Concession Agreement was terminated, and the NHAI took over the section. The notification details the fee structure for various vehicle types, differentiating between the construction period (six-laning) and after completion. Fees are calculated based on the base rate per kilometer, with adjustments for the length of the road section and equivalent structure length (bridges, flyovers). Table 1 provides the base rates for different vehicle categories. Table 2 specifies the location of toll plazas and the length for which fees are payable. Table 3 details the fee structure for structures. The document also includes provisions for monthly passes for local residents, discounts for commercial vehicles registered in the district, and penalties for overloaded vehicles. The notification also states that no user fee shall be levied for the delayed period between the Scheduled date of completion and the date of actual completion of the project.
