        "content": "_ Capgemini demonstrated its agility and resilience once again in 2023. The Group \nwithstood the slowdown in demand which was most likely due to higher inflation and rising \ninterest rates. We continued to invest and consolidate our status as a partner to our clients \nsupporting their business and technology transformations. Despite the decline in demand, \nthe Group improved its operating margin. The market\u2019s reaction to Capgemini\u2019s performance \ndemonstrated investors\u2019 trust in the Group, in its captain, Aiman, and his entire crew. It is a \nwell-known fact that we see who the best helmsmen are in light winds! It is therefore no \ncoincidence to me that Capgemini is a partner to the America\u2019s Cup, an iconic sailing \ncompetition that takes innovation and technology to the highest level.\nEverything still, and always, comes down to technology and innovation. Artificial intelligence \nhas become the driving force behind transformation, with the sudden emergence of \ngenerative AI. Everyone has seen how, at tremendous speed, it has transformed the day-to-\nday lives of businesses and citizens alike. In record time, this technology has started being \nused in ways that we never thought imaginable, and its potential is seemingly boundless. In \nany case, generative artificial intelligence is ushering in a new era. The press likes to point \nout the risks associated with it (hallucinations, bias, the spread of deepfakes, intellectual \nproperty rights violations, high energy consumption, etc.). But we are truly on the verge of \na revolution that will boost productivity and completely reshape many sectors. So, as always, \nwe must redouble our vigilance and our efforts. Some might be tempted to rely entirely on \nregulation. But we should remember that what we need to control is how technology is used. \nWe must beware of giving in to the absurd idea of censoring technology itself.\nYour Board of Directors, which I have the pleasure of chairing, ensures the proper governance \nof the company. Its composition changed again in 2023. At your Annual General Shareholder\u2019s \nMeeting, two new members were voted in: Megan Clarken and Ulrica Fearn. They very quickly \ncontributed to our work through their sector expertise and their understanding of financial \naspects, inclusion and diversity, digital transformation and the US and Asian markets.\nI started this letter with a sailing metaphor, and I\u2019d like to end it with reference to a sport \nthat is even more beloved at Capgemini. The 2023 Rugby World Cup, which we sponsored, \nbrought out the enthusiasm and attachment that many of our employees feel towards this \nsport. At the risk of offending some, I would like to pay tribute to the winners, South Africa. \nThe country\u2019s team showed uncommon strength of character. They beat France, England \nand New Zealand, each time by one tiny point. It is a testament to collective spirit, resilience \nand extraordinary mindset and strength of character. And that is the beauty of this sport. \nSerge Kampf would undoubtedly be extremely happy to see that his passion for rugby reigns \nas strong as ever in the Group he founded over fifty years ago. Serge was crazy about rugby, \nbecause he believed that it was the ultimate team sport. You cannot achieve anything in \nrugby without total engagement from all teammates, and every try is an achievement for the \nentire team. These collective values resonate intensely with those of Capgemini and continue \nto guide us today.\n\u201cEVERYTHING STILL, AND ALWAYS, \nCOMES DOWN TO TECHNOLOGY \nAND INNOVATION.\u201d\nPAUL \nHERMELIN\nCHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD\nCAPGEMINI INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023\n10\n11\nLETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN",

We are a responsible business and \nwe are systematically taking the necessary actions \nto create a more sustainable and inclusive world. \nWe are leading the way with bold innovations to \nreduce our carbon footprint: 96% of the electricity \nthe Group consumes is now renewable and our \ncarbon emissions, across all three scopes, have \ndecreased by 30% since 2019. In terms of social \nresponsibility, we continue to make strides and \nemployee training and upskilling remain our \nnumber one priority. The Group has strengthened \nits commitment to diversity and inclusion and \nI am proud of the way we are upholding the values \nof respect, tolerance and inclusion.\nIn this report you will discover what Capgemini \nstands for, its vision and the value we bring to \nour clients.

The report also highlighted \nthe power of consumer\u00adled conservation efforts, \nsuch as the EcoMode campaign in the UK that \nresulted in a remarkable 12% reduction in household \nenergy consumption. Now in its 25th edition, the \nreport tracks the development and transformation \nof electricity and gas markets across Europe, North \nAmerica, Australia, Southeast Asia, India and China. \nIt is prepared by a global team of over 100 experts \nand includes 40 articles, all backed by rigorous analysis.\nSOLUTIONS FOR THE WORLD OF AVIATION\n Capgemini is strengthening its position \nas a sustainable partner and helping push the \nboundaries of aerial mobility by working with French \naeronautical company Euro Airship on the design, \nmanufacturing and assembly of the Solar Airship \nOne.

        "content": "_ What skills and qualities do today\u2019s \nemployees require to stay at the forefront \nin serving client business needs?\nANNE LEBEL: This is an essential question \nfor those of us working in human resources. \nThe blurring lines between business and \ntechnology across all industries require a new \nbreed of talent that combines technical skills \nand industry expertise\u2026 But that is just the start. \nIn today\u2019s fast-changing world, we attach \nincreased importance to social and emotional \ncapabilities: adaptability, empathy, storytelling \n\u2013 because these are character traits needed to \nunderstand the challenges our clients face today. \nA good example of these challenges is the surge \nof generative AI onto the scene in 2023. \nOur responsibility is to ensure that our people are \nat the forefront of technology to bring value to \nour clients. To this end, Capgemini announced in \nJuly 2023 that it would invest \u20ac2 billion to strengthen \nits leadership in AI over the next three years.\nWe\u2019ve adopted a holistic approach to encouraging \nand nurturing talent through which we provide our \nemployees with industry\u00adspecific knowledge at \nevery stage of their careers. This starts on day one: \nnew team members are onboarded in an industry, \nthey are expected to develop a defined set of skills, \nthey are trained through our industry campus, and \neven certified in order to recognize their expertise \naccordingly. They also join an online community, \nwhere they can address industry challenges \nthrough expert support, knowledge assets, peer \nengagement and by collaborating with partners. \nSo, it\u2019s really a long-term commitment.\nWe are a global and diverse company, and it \nis important to grow and learn from each other. \nOur professional communities bring together \nexperts no matter where they live and work \nand, through them, individuals can receive \ntailored online support, peer\u00adto\u00adpeer learning \nand participate in community events so that \nemployees can develop the skills they need to \nperform and grow in a more informal setting. \nPeople also learn from experience. \nOur commitment extends to crafting career \npathways that enable individuals to broaden \ntheir expertise by transitioning seamlessly across \ndiverse roles and business domains.\n_ What makes working at Capgemini special?\nA. L.: Over the past few years, Capgemini has \nfocused on providing a highly engaging people \nexperience, with attention given to key moments \nthat matter in our employees\u2019 lives. We take pride \nin our culture and founding values such as fun \nand team spirit. We want new joiners to feel \nwelcome from day one, so our onboarding \nincludes a buddy program for early support and \nnetworking opportunities.\nAt Capgemini we truly believe in our hybrid model: \nwith hybrid working possibilities and flexibility \nin terms of working hours and work location, \nour employees can balance their professional \nambition with their personal life.\nWe have active employee-led networks, such \nas Women@Capgemini, OUTfront and CapAbility, \ndedicated to advancing diversity, equity, and \ninclusion both in the workplace and in society at \nlarge. Employees today are driven to tackle social \ncauses such as climate change and biodiversity. \nThrough our global tech challenges, they can learn \nhow to use technology for innovative solutions. \nThis commitment to being an employer of \nchoice was once again rewarded last year \nby our inclusion in the Universum Top 50 most \nattractive employers for IT students globally.\n_ How does Capgemini build leadership?\nA. L.: We recognize that a new type of leadership \nis needed to \u201cunleash human energy through \ntechnology for an inclusive and sustainable \nfuture.\u201d This is reflected in our leadership vision, \nand we look for well-rounded leaders who \nput the client first and can deliver our strategic \nambition to be a leading transformation and \ntechnology partner. \nWe put a premium on promoting, to leadership \npositions, employees with a variety of skills, \nknowledge, and experience. Mobility within \nthe Group has always been a key lever to grow \nleaders and enrich their experience. \nWe expect our leaders to inspire people and be \nattentive to diverse needs. Guiding teams in \ntheir development, providing feedback, betting \non talent, and taking risks to develop people \nare key principles we want our leaders to \ndemonstrate. And as a multicultural company, \nwe expect leaders to be inclusive. They are \nequipped to adopt and promote inclusive \nmanagerial practices. Unconscious bias and \ninclusive behaviors are embedded into all our \nflagship leadership trainings. In 2023, our \nexecutive and senior leadership volunteered \nto host inclusion circles, to have open discussions \nwith their teams either about unconscious \nbias or the value of diversity and inclusion \nin business.\nAnd it\u2019s not just about acquiring generative AI \nexpertise. It is about leading in this field and \napplying the technology in new and meaningful \nways across our clients\u2019 value chains.\n_ How does Capgemini help its people to grow?\nA. L.: We want to build a company of \u201clearn\u00adit\u00adalls\u201d, \nnot \u201cknow\u00adit\u00adalls\u201d, turning potential into business \nvalue and ensuring our employees\u2019 sustainability and \nlong-term employability as their careers progress \nacross Capgemini and beyond. We have developed \na diverse and rich learning offering, aligned with our \nstrategic objectives. Our digital learning platform \nembeds learning paths developed with prestigious \nknowledge and technology partners including \nHarvard Business. We are committed to increasing \nthe learning hours of every employee.

        "content": "OUR PEOPLE\nSPEAK\nSKILLS EVOLUTION\n \u201cCapgemini has this amazing in-house \ndigital training platform called Next. We update it \nevery year to make sure we promote new content \non the latest technology. I\u2019m aware that we\u2019re \noperating in a space where technology is evolving \nat unprecedented speed. It\u2019s vital for us to be \nconstantly upskilling our existing workforce, to make \nsure their skill sets stay up-to-date and relevant. \nWhen I joined in 2019, I mandated that every \nemployee in our service should get several hours of \ntechnical training each year. We built wide-ranging \ntraining and certification programs for our teams \nwith hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google and AWS \nto give staff opportunities to develop new technical \nskills. As the complexity of what we are managing \nincreases, we\u2019re encouraging our specialists \nnot only to deepen their expertise in their chosen \ntechnology but also to expand their knowledge \nmore broadly, so they can effectively manage two \nor three technologies.\u201d\nLEADERSHIP\n \u201cOver the past four years I\u2019ve \nbeen involved in the Empow\u2019Her program, \nan international network of organizations \nthat empowers women to grow and develop, \nnurturing their freedom and capacity to excel \nin entrepreneurship. This has really helped me \nbuild my leadership skills. It gives me 360-degree \nfeedback and assessments, and helps me identify \nmy strong points and the ones I need to work on. \nI was put in touch with a mentor, who\u2019s based in \nIndia and has given me invaluable tips and opened \nnetworking opportunities to me. Today I manage \na team of 1,200 people 45% of whom are women. \nI think they appreciate that I\u2019m authentic with \nthem; sometimes I speak to them in a Moroccan \ndialect, so they feel at ease. They\u2019re also interested \nin learning how I became a manager after starting \nmy career so young. This is important since \nMorocco now has a growing pool of engineering \ntalent on the international scene and I want \nto encourage young women to be part of it.\u201d\nKARINE BRUNET\nCEO, CLOUD \nINFRASTRUCTURE \nSERVICES\nBOUCHRA MELLAS\nDIRECTOR ER&D \nMOROCCO\nMARTIN SCOTT\nHEAD OF PRACTICES UK\nPERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT\n \u201cAt Capgemini, we celebrate the things \nthat go right and give employees regular and \nappropriate feedback to help them learn when \nthings don\u2019t go so well. For that to work, we\u2019ve \ncreated a safe environment so that they feel \nsufficiently supported to ask for help when \nneeded. We need to clearly set realistic goals \ntogether, not just their ultimate goal, but also \nthe signposts along the way. For me, performance \nmanagement is demonstrating we care about \nsomeone\u2019s development. It\u2019s not about following \na process although clearly a process is involved, \nbut it\u2019s really about getting under the covers of \nwhy someone has joined Capgemini and why they \nwant to pursue their career with us. It\u2019s being clear \non an individual\u2019s dreams and aspirations. We \nneed to understand that as leaders and managers \nso that we can support their progression. It\u2019s also \nmaking sure people feel that they have a voice. \nI always look at performance management as an \nopportunity to learn in both directions.\u201d\nSKILLS EVOLUTION\n \u201cThe skills required to deliver value-driven \ntransformation have grown massively in importance. \nToday, clients expect us to understand the \nchallenges of their business, their industry and \ntheir competitive positioning. So we all have to \nbe multi-skilled now. Our top talent programs \nand our leadership development programs focus \non shaping a continuous learning mindset that \nforms the building blocks for self-development. \nWhile you can\u2019t be an expert in everything, what\u2019s \nmost important is knowing where to find that \nexpert \u2013 and having the network to reach out \nto that person. Personally, the opportunities \nI\u2019ve had to connect and network, through learning \nand upskilling programs and initiatives, have \nbeen the single biggest factor to positively impact \nmy career at Capgemini. I know that I can rely \non the expertise of my peers and their desire to \nshare their knowledge. These are essential \nin my role as delivery head and really help me \ndeliver value to my client.\u201d\nMOBILITY\n \u201cInternal job mobility has truly been a \ngame-changer for my career within the company. In \nmy case I initiated the transfer from India to Canada, \nwhere I had applied for a visa. My HR managers were \nvery supportive and I was introduced to the North \nAmerican leads. This internal move has allowed \nme to acquire a diverse set of skills and these new \nskills have helped me expand my professional \nnetwork. Transitioning to a more client-facing role \nas an engagement manager has enhanced my \nconversational and presentation skills, as well as my \nstakeholder management abilities. I gained a deeper \nunderstanding of the end-to-end process, from \nproposal submission to contract execution and \ndelivery. Today, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to seamlessly \nintegrate into a new culture while maintaining \nmy career trajectory. The organization supported \nmy learning journey through internal workshops \nand trainings, enabling me to grasp the prerequisites \nfor success in my new role. And in return, they can \nleverage my contacts and experience.\u201d\nANCHITA MAJITA\nENGAGEMENT MANAGER \nCANADA\nRACHEL GREEDY\nDELIVERY HEAD UK\nCAPGEMINI INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023\n24\n25\nTALENT",

I need to \nunderstand what processes we need to put into \nplace for our clients and then to train the delivery \nteam. Performance management helps me to \ngrow by setting objectives. For example, \nI\u2019ll identify areas for improvement and then \nI\u2019ll upskill myself in the required technologies \nand I\u2019ll give myself a timeline. At Capgemini \nwe have very frequent performance reviews, \nwith quarterly reviews, then a final end-of-year \nreview to help us track our progress and \nunderstand our strengths and weaknesses. \nThese frequent check-ins mean that if there\u2019s \nsomething we haven\u2019t achieved in the first \nquarter, we can still try to achieve or accomplish \nit in the second or third quarter. We have constant \nfeedback on what\u2019s going well and what needs \nimprovement, or areas where a deep dive is \nneeded. And you can ask for this feedback from \nanyone in the organization. Your manager, peers, \nor other colleagues and stakeholders give you \na wide variety of points of view. This pushes you \nin a good way and you always know where you \nstand.

Being \nable to network with teams who have different \nexpertise and perspectives from across the \nGroup and enabling connections amongst these \nexperts is a leadership skill that I have learned \nand developed at Capgemini. I would say \nthat I now lead differently, to inspire and give \na voice to a community of 2,000 architects. \nI\u2019m really proud to see how we\u2019ve created \nan open and honest community, where people \nare empowered and motivated to contribute \non projects like our financial services playbook \nor industry-specific gen AI use cases.\u201d\nSUDHIR PAI\nCTIO FOR FINANCIAL \nSERVICES\nWhat if you could rewrite the future?\nAt Capgemini, you can.

This synergy \nnot only addresses environmental challenges: it \nimproves economic and social well-being, marking \na decisive shift towards a more resilient future. \nAs long-standing partners, Schneider Electric and \nCapgemini are working together to explore the \nmany benefits of this high value-creating duality. \nBut how can it be aligned with business strategies \nand how to measure progress? Peter Herweck, \nCEO of Schneider Electric, and Aiman Ezzat, \nexchanged views at the World Economic Forum \nin Davos, Switzerland, in January 2024.\n_ How do you see the relationship between \nsustainability and digital transformation in the \nbusiness landscape?\nPETER HERWECK: Sustainability impacts the \nentire company, and it equals going electric plus \ndigitalization. To start improving, companies \nneed to begin with a transparent assessment of \ntheir electric and water consumptions, and carbon \nfootprint. Then, modern technologies come in: \n80% of all CO2 emissions are energy-related, \nand there are technologies available that can \nreduce these emissions by 70%. So, there\u2019s \nno reason to wait.\nAIMAN EZZAT: Digital and sustainability \ntransformation are intertwined. By leveraging \ndigital in their operations, from product \ndevelopment to manufacturing and operations, \nbusinesses can leverage vast amounts of data \nand become insights-driven in real time, \nthus creating opportunities for more efficient, \nresilient, and sustainable business models. \nIn the end, the two transformations feed off \nhour by hour. In one year, the deployment of \ntechnology to measure and manage energy \nconsumption led to a 15% reduction. In Singapore, \na global biopharmaceutical company digitized its \nproduction to understand its energy expenditure, \nthen installed solar panels on the roofs and \nstarted producing its own energy, so that by \nthe end of the project it had achieved net zero. \nSo, it is not just a question of saving the planet, \nbut of creating a new sustainable business \nmodel, while generating financial benefits \nin the very short term.\n_ What role does technology, and \ndigitalization in particular, play in sustainable \ndevelopment efforts?\nA. E.: Over half of chief executive officers are \nleveraging digital technology as a pivotal tool \nto attain their environmental sustainability \nobjectives. Data is a must to understand \nand track sustainability progress. AI-based \ninnovations play a crucial role in enhancing \ncorporate energy efficiency. This significant \nimprovement is achievable through the \ncollaborative efforts of digital and sustainability \nteams, emphasizing the importance of synergy \nbetween technological innovation and \nenvironmental stewardship.\nP. H.: Digital will continue to support sustainable \ndevelopment goals, everywhere on the planet. \nFor example, we know that more than 3 billion \npeople will move to cities in the coming years, \nmainly in the southern hemisphere. We will \nhave new megacities with a young population \nthat will require cities with controlled energy \nconsumption, and therefore largely digitalized. \nIndia has understood this well: more than \n13 smart cities are being built on this model.\n_ Within your own companies, how do you \nevaluate the progress of these transformations?\nP. H.: This is long-term, large-scale work: when \ncompanies lease ten office buildings under \na ten-year contract, it makes sense to invest \nin reducing energy consumption. We leased \nour Singapore offices for 25 years, and the \nbuilding was already 25 years old. Thanks \nto our renovation, it is now one of the most \nenergy-efficient buildings in the city.\nA. E.: We have made strong progress over the \nyears and we are already mobilizing technology \nto achieve our sustainability goals. For example, \nin India, our teams worked with Schneider Electric \nto set up a common energy center at our facilities; \nThe system is fully automatic, based on AI, and \nallows us to adjust our consumption in real time. \nWe reduced our consumption by 29% in the \nfirst year alone. We are now taking this system \nto the market, to help our clients within their \nown structures. This is another example of how \ntechnology is necessary, but not sufficient, to \nachieve these transformations: collaboration is key \nif we want to find adapted, innovative solutions.\neach other and share similarities: the scale of \nthe change they entail, their impact on corporate \nbusiness models, the large number of stakeholders \ninvolved, the necessity to work in ecosystems, \nand, of course the need to act quickly!\n_ Given the growing importance attached \nto sustainability targets, how do you deal with \nthe differences in levels of awareness, motivation, \nand investment between companies?\nA. E.: Constant education and awareness is \nrequired to embark stakeholders on the right \npath, at the right pace. For example, two years \nago, we set up a sustainability campus within \nCapgemini, and trained all our 340,000 employees \nto understand the challenge. This type of initiative \ncould be a model, as the imperatives are the \nsame for everyone. We are today at a crossroads \nand there is willingness to act. Over the past \ntwo years, we have witnessed a profound change, \nas sustainability is no longer perceived as a cost, \nbut as a business case and a business benefit(1).\n_ As sustainability becomes a critical aspect \nof business strategy, what initiatives do you \nundertake to align shareholder returns with \nstakeholder expectations for sustainability?\nP. H.: These dimensions are no longer \ncontradictory, and we have many concrete \nexamples to put forward to prove that this is, \nabove all, an approach that makes good \nbusiness sense. Whatever the sector, a more \nsustainable model can be implemented with \na return on investment in two or three years. \nIn France, for example, a 600-year-old hotel began \nto monitor its energy consumption, room by room, \nINNOVATION\nAND\nSUSTAINABILITY\n(1) According to the Capgemini Research Institute \u201cSustainability \ntrends 2023\u201d report, 63% of executives agreed that the business \ncase for sustainability is clear.
