In 2021, we reported a 61.6% reduction of emissions since 2010. Over the last two years we completed a total of 1,455 energy conservation projects. As a result of conservation projects implemented in 2022, we avoided 71,000 MWh of energy consumption and 25,600 metric tons of CO2 emissions. We also diverted 93.8% (by weight) of IBM’s total nonhazardous waste from landfill or incineration. Last year we held our first annual Supplier Sustainability Leadership Symposium to promote energy efficiency. I invite you to read more about our efforts in this comprehensive report. While we are proud of the progress we have made, we are mindful that advancing our environmental, social and governance goals is a continuous journey of improvement.

This includes evaluation of ESG-related risks. Oversight of risk management begins with our Board of Directors, which is responsible for assessing our ERM approach and overseeing management’s execution of its risk responsibilities. IBM’s risk professionals, including the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), work closely with senior management to integrate risk assessment into Board and committee briefings on topics of strategic importance.

On a comparative basis with 2021, both purchasing spend and number of suppliers are considerably reduced as a result of the separation of our managed infrastructure business in November 2021. Since 2010, IBM has required its first-tier suppliers to create and maintain a social and environmental management system to address their responsibilities within a year of starting to do business with us. IBM suppliers must establish their management systems, measure performance, set goals, disclose results, and cascade these requirements to their upstream suppliers who perform work material to the goods and services provided to IBM.

Versus 2021, IBM observed a net reduction in the number of code nonconformance reported from these RBA full audits. This was the result of the positive impact of our supplier engagement (training and consultation on the shortfalls within their RBA Self-Assessment Questionnaires), and a higher ratio of hardware suppliers audited (most with prior RBA audit experience). In 2022, IBM collaborated with 46 suppliers to plan and execute RBA reaudits to vet corrective action plans associated with full audits performed during 2021-2022. These reaudits yielded a 71% improvement in conformance from the findings in the related full audits. In this same group, 48% of suppliers attained full conformance to the RBA Code after one cycle of audit, correction action, and reaudit. We rema",

Through our membership in the RBA, we have been active in addressing this issue. In 2020, RBA membership adopted a code change that explicitly addressed parameters to prevent forced labor in the supply chain. We have built upon the RBA code provisions to develop online training for our buyers and employees and have collaborated with external parties to create a technology platform to assist multi-stakeholders in interrupting modern slavery. Annually, we publish two reports in response to Australian and United Kingdom legislation with details on our activities to combat modern slavery and forced labor.

Most of our data centers now incorporate hot/cold aisle containment.2 In addition, we continued to execute projects aimed at enhancing the energy efficiency of both cooling and IT equipment, retrofitting lighting systems, and optimizing the operational efficiency of our building infrastructure. 1In measuring performance against IBM’s energy conservation goal, we only include the first year’s savings from projects.

Accordingly, IBM’s total energy savings and CO2 emissions avoidance from these projects are greater than this simple summation of the annual results. We do not include reductions in energy consumption resulting from downsizings, the sale of operations or cost-avoidance actions, such as fuel switching and off-peak load shifting, in our energy conservation results. 2Hot/cold aisle containment is a strategy used in data centers to improve energy efficiency and reduce cooling costs. It involves organizing server racks in a way that achieves the greatest separation of hot exhaust air and cold intake air. In 2021, we set a goal of 3,000 energy conservation projects by 2025. We have completed 1,455 as of year-end 2022, avoiding 161,000 MWh of energy consumption. From 1990 through 2022, we conserved 10 million MWh of energy—equivalent to ",

That total includes 49.3% renewable electricity directly contracted from our power suppliers, in addition to the other 14.9% that is a part of the remaining electricity we obtain directly from the grid.* When reporting our consumption of renewable electricity, we count only what is generated in the grid regions where our consumption actually occurs. We do not purchase unbundled renewable energy certificates representing energy we cannot consume, which would inflate our results. For more information about how we calculate our consumption of renewable electricity, please visit our website.

Water Conservation Our water conservation goal is to achieve year- to-year reductions in water withdrawals at larger IBM locations in water-stressed regions. In 2022, withdrawals at these locations decreased by 0.19% versus 2021. This decrease in water withdrawals was primarily due to temporary or permanent building closures and reduced lawn irrigation, including some lawn irrigation reductions mandated by government. For example, three major projects involved lawn conversions that replaced over 100,000 square feet of grassy area with drought resistant native plants reducing the total annual landscape irrigation by approximately 9,200 cubic meters. In addition, we reused or recycled over 24,000 cubic meters of water for landscape irrigation. Other water conservation efforts consisted of the installation of faucet aerators, reduce f",

Results from our efforts to reduce water withdrawals during 2022 were largely offset as more employees returned to offices. Our primary use of water at locations subject to this goal is domestic water consumption in the workplace (46% of total water withdrawals), cooling and humidity control at office buildings (25% of total water withdrawals), and irrigation of lawns and gardens (19% of total water withdrawals). We installed more than 100 water meters in campuses in India and South America which resulted in more accurate measurement of our water consumption in multi-tenant buildings where we previously relied upon estimates.

These materials complement those previously developed for establishing and maintaining pollinator gardens and have been shared with employees worldwide. In addition, four IBM sites (IBM Corporate Headquarters, New York; IBM Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; IBM Almaden Research Center and IBM Silicon Valley Laboratory, both in California) have maintained WHC Conservation Certification for their wildlife habitat management and conservation education programs for decades, with IBM Almaden Research Center receiving the first site certification in 1991.

Pollution Prevention and Waste Management We believe the best way to prevent pollution is to avoid the generation of waste at its source. For waste that is generated, we minimize pollution through a comprehensive and proactive waste management program that calls for implementation of the following practices, in order of preference: (1) reuse, (2) recycling, (3) recovery (e.g., waste-to-energy), (4) other treatment (e.g., aqueous and chemical treatments, incineration), and (5) land disposal.

Nonhazardous Waste Our nonhazardous waste goal has two integral components and encompasses IBM-owned locations and leased locations of 100,000 square feet or greater worldwide. 1. Divert 90% or more (by weight) of our total nonhazardous waste from landfill and incineration by 2025, through reuse, recycling, composting, and waste-to-energy processes. 2. Use waste-to-energy processes for no more than 10% (by weight) of the diverted waste. In 2022, reporting locations generated nearly 14,800 MT of nonhazardous waste worldwide, diverting 93.8% (by weight) from landfill or incineration, and meeting the first component of our goal. Of the total amount diverted, however, 11.9% (by weight) was sent to waste-to-energy processes. We continue to work toward reducing the amount of material sent to waste-to-energy processes to reduce this pe",

We continue to work toward reducing the amount of material sent to waste-to-energy processes to reduce this percentage to less than 10% and achieve the second component of our goal. The waste diversion results were achieved through proper management of end-of-life IT equipment, parts, and product scrap across IBM’s global asset recovery network; improved waste collection infrastructure resulting in better sorting of waste; promotion of the IBM Furniture Donation Program for employees and external organizations; and the continued focus on elimination of nonessential, single-use plastic items from our cafeterias.

In 2022, we continued our efforts with our largest cafeteria vendor (based on 2021 spend) and successfully eliminated or replaced all nonessential, single-use plastic items from 21 IBM-managed cafeterias operated by this vendor in the U.S., Latin America and Canada.1 Some examples included replacing plastic knives, forks and spoons with metal or bamboo alternatives, and replacing plastic containers with paper-based containers. Collectively, these efforts eliminated the annual use of approximately 11.9 MT (1.4 million items) of nonessential, single-use plastic items.

Empty wood pallets from the assembly plant are returned to the local parts supplier for reuse in shipping new components back to the assembly plant. The pallets are painted green for tracking purposes and on average can be used twice saving approximately 8 MT of timber annually. To continue to minimize packaging waste in the supply chain, we worked with a partner that provides certain storage products to our assembly plant in Mexico to design packaging that is then reused to ship the complete order to customers. The estimated annual avoidance is 16 MT of packaging materials, including over 2.6 MT of LDPE materials. 1The vendor previously removed all nonessential, single-use plastic items at IBM-managed cafeterias located in countries in the European Union (EU) in accordance with the EU Directive, 2019/904, on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment, and national i",

Today, we have more than 2,600 monitoring wells and nearly 70 extraction wells in place at our current and former locations. In 2022, we operated remediation systems that removed approximately 9,400 pounds of solvents from groundwater and soil vapor at three currently operating IBM locations and 11 former IBM locations.
